# Probabilistic computations

Randomness enters the framework as one more oracle: oracle `m` of `unifSpec` answers a uniformly
random element of `Fin (m + 1)`, and a uniform element of any nonempty finite type is obtained
through an enumeration. A *probabilistic computation* (`ProbComp`) is an oracle computation whose
only oracle is this one. Security games, once their adversary is plugged in and their oracles
implemented, are probabilistic computations.

The semantics is elementary and real-valued. The expectation of `g` over the output of a
computation is defined by recursion on the computation: a return contributes `g a`, and a sampling
step averages over its `m + 1` equally likely answers. There are no measures and no extended
reals: every computation is a finite tree with finite branching, so every probability is a finite
sum of rationals. The probability of an event is the expectation of its indicator. For a
computation with a finite output type, its output distribution is a `FinDist` of the library's
information-theory layer, so statistical distance and closeness (`EpsClose`) apply directly.

## Main definitions

* `Games.unifSpec`: the uniform-sampling oracles; `Games.ProbComp`: computations over them.
* `Games.ProbComp.sampleFin m`, `Games.ProbComp.sample T`: a uniform element of `Fin (m + 1)`, and
  of a nonempty finite type `T`.
* `Games.ProbComp.expect c g`: the expectation of `g` over the output of `c`.
* `Games.ProbComp.prob c p`: the probability that the output of `c` satisfies `p`.
* `Games.ProbComp.dist c`: the output distribution of `c`, for a finite output type.

## Main results

* `ProbComp.expect_bind`: **total expectation**; sequencing averages the continuations.
* `ProbComp.expect_sample`: sampling a finite type is the uniform average.
* `ProbComp.expect_add`, `expect_const_mul`, `expect_sum`, `expect_mono`: linearity and
  monotonicity.
* `ProbComp.prob_nonneg`, `prob_le_one`, `prob_mono`, `prob_or_le` (the union bound),
  `prob_not`, `prob_bind`.

  indexed by a type of oracle names (`VCVio/OracleComp/OracleSpec.lean`), oracle computations as
  a free monad over them (`OracleComp.lean`, `OracleQuery.lean`), probabilistic computations as
  computations over the uniform-selection oracles (`OracleComp/ProbComp/Basic.lean`), and
  simulation of oracles by stateful handlers with query logging and composition (`SimSemantics/`,
  `SimSemantics/QueryImpl/Compose.lean`, `QueryTracking/LoggingOracle`).
  Uniform sampling as an oracle follows VCVio's uniform-selection oracle; the real-valued
  finite-sum semantics here is not VCVio's (which is measure-valued).
