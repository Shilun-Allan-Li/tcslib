# The class P

`P` is the class of languages decidable in polynomial time: the union over `c` of
`DTIME (n^c + 1)`. [AB09, Definition 1.13, with the `+ 1` padding explained below —
every *positive*-degree component of the literal unpadded union is empty in this model,
since `n^c` vanishes at `n = 0` and no machine halts in zero steps; [AB09]'s union
ranges over `c ≥ 1`, so its literal reading is empty, while including degree `0` would
give exactly `DTIME 1` (in Lean `0 ^ 0 = 1`).]

## Design and deviations from [AB09]

* We take the union of `DTIME (fun n => n ^ c + 1)` over all `c : ℕ` where [AB09] writes
  `⋃_{c ≥ 1} DTIME(n^c)`. The `+ 1` repairs the empty-input degeneracy: a machine needs
  at least one step to halt, so for the degrees `d ≥ 1` of [AB09]'s union no language
  whatsoever is decided within `c · 0^d = 0` steps on the empty input, and the literal
  [AB09] definition would (vacuously) exclude even constant-time machines on that input. For `n ≥ 1` the bounds `c · (n^d + 1)` and
  `c' · n^d` sandwich each other, so this is the standard reading of the same class.
  Ranging over `c = 0` too is harmless: `n^0 + 1 = 2` is a constant bound, subsumed by
  larger `c`.

## Main definitions

* `Complexity.P` — [AB09, Definition 1.13].

## Main results

* `Complexity.dtime_poly_subset_P` — each `DTIME (n^c + 1)` is contained in `P`.
* `Complexity.mem_P_iff` — `P` is exactly the class decidable within `C · (n + 1) ^ d`
  for some constants, certifying that the `+ 1` padding has the conventional
  polynomial-time content.

/-- Membership in `P` from a concrete polynomial bound: if `L` is decidable within any
time bound that is pointwise dominated by a polynomial, then `L ∈ P`. (Pointwise, not
eventual, domination: an eventual-bound variant follows with the *same machine* by
absorbing the finitely many exceptional bounds into the constant, and is deferred.)

**Proof sketch.** Pick `c` and `d` with `T n ≤ c * (n ^ d + 1)` for all `n`. By
`Complexity.DTIME.mono`, `DTIME T ⊆ DTIME (fun n => c * (n ^ d + 1))`; the latter equals
a subclass of `DTIME (fun n => n ^ d + 1)` because the constant `c` is absorbed by the
existential constant in the definition of `DTIME` (the two constants multiply). Conclude
with `Complexity.dtime_poly_subset_P`. -/

/-- `P` is exactly the class of languages decidable within `C · (n + 1) ^ d` steps for
some constants `C` and `d`. This certifies that the `+ 1` padding in the definition of
`P` has the conventional polynomial-time content: forward, a witness for the degree-`c`
component gives a bound `a · (n ^ c + 1) ≤ 2a · (n + 1) ^ c`; backward, `succ_pow_le`
turns a `C · (n + 1) ^ d` decider into a `(C · 2 ^ d) · (n ^ d + 1)` decider, landing
in the degree-`d` component. (`audits/phase1-findings.md`, "Polynomial-time
