<!-- DRAFT (maintainer, 2026-10-27): v2.6 as the E-Q review proposes it
(`campaign/fills/eq/reviews/fill-cp1/REVIEW.md`, "Proposed wording", decision 1); adopted only on
the user's ruling. -->

# Fill-agent environment addendum (v2.6): resources, the dependency cache, starting Lean, and megafills

**Version 2.6 (⟨date of the ruling⟩)** clarifies the one-Lean rule, from megafill D's record (its
E-SERIAL stopped an item for the cache tool's own parallel build, a 0.3 s overlap inside
`lake exe cache get`, before the item's branch existed):
- **the cache tool's own work is outside the one-Lean rule** (Part 1, item 2);
- **a Lean process is one that you start** (Part 3, item 5);
- **a process deviation never ends an item** (Part 3, a new item 7).

**Version 2.5 (2026-10-22)** changes two rules of Part 1, item 2, from the first megafills' records
(gates 59 and 60):
- **the manifest check counts the packages present** in `.lake/packages`. The narrowed fetch does
  not clone the documentation toolchain, so a check of every package in the manifest failed by
  construction;
- **the cache tool's local archive store is logged before the first fetch.** One host already held
  967 of the 1,002 archives it needed, with no record of where they came from. Archives already
  in that store are the cache tool's own, named by hash and checked by it: **using them is
  allowed** (user, 2026-10-22), and the store is logged and reported.

Parts 2 and 3 are otherwise unchanged (Part 3's shared fetch logs the store once).

**Version 2.4 (2026-10-22)** adds **Part 3, the megafill**: one session that works through a queue
of fill briefs on one host, sharing the preflight, the toolchain, the clone and the cache. Parts 1
and 2 are unchanged except for one clarification in item 2 (the cache tool compiles itself on
first use). Version 2.3's narrowed cache fetch passed on its first two uses (2026-10-21: 35 roots
and 967 files; 40 roots and 1,002 files; no failed download, no retry).

**Version 2.3 (2026-10-18).** Part 1, the resource and cache rules, applies on **every** host
(the user's authorization of 2026-10-17). **Version 2.3** changes one rule: **the dependency cache
is fetched for your brief's Mathlib roots only** (items 2–4), never in full. On the fill hosts of
2026-10-18 the network proxy refused about 1,900 of the full cache's 7,506 files
(`CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403`), the same files on every host, while a fetch narrowed to a
brief's imports (about 1,000 files) succeeded. The narrowed cache also needs far less disk.

**Version 2.2** changed one rule, **when the free-disk
floor applies** (item 1), and updates the measured Lean peak; nothing else. The 12 GiB floor is a
start-of-run figure that includes installing the toolchain (about 4.2 GiB with its archive). A
re-check after the toolchain is installed needs only the cache step's share, 8 GiB. Two hosts of
2026-10-18 stopped with E-RES on a 12 GiB re-check after installing the toolchain.

**Version 2.1** changed two things:
- **the memory headroom counts memory in use, not the page cache** (items 1 and 6). Version 2's
  `limit − memory.current` counted the kernel's file cache, which fills a cgroup to its limit
  after the dependency cache is downloaded and unpacked, and is reclaimed on demand. Two hosts
  of 2026-10-18 stopped with E-RES at 0.09 and 1.3 GiB "headroom" while their anonymous memory
  was 0.2 and 0.08 GB, with no OOM event;
- **`lake exe cache get` runs with `TAR_OPTIONS=--no-same-owner`** (item 2): on hosts that forbid
  `chown`, the cache tool's own `leantar` archive otherwise fails to install
  (`Cannot change ownership to uid 1001`).

Part 2, the shim for an unreadable `/proc/<pid>/exe`, is version 1's text, unchanged (authorized
2026-10-14). Everything else in your brief stays binding; where it names an earlier version of
this addendum, read v2.5.

## Part 1: resources and the dependency cache

**Why.** Four fill workers of 2026-10-17 stopped before any proof check, all for host reasons. The
dependency cache filled the disk (`No space left on device`, `leantar` exit 101). One worker staged
files on `/dev/shm`, which counts against the memory limit, and others copied dependency trees
between directories. Empty or truncated oleans, a stale compiled Lake configuration and a Lake
re-clone of Mathlib (package URLs differing from the manifest) followed. Lean then crashed
(SIGBUS 135, SIGSEGV 139) or stalled at a full memory limit. The rules below stop that early and
cleanly.

1. **Preflight, before any cache or Lean work.** Record in `evidence/logs/preflight.log`, and quote
   in `REPORT.md`:
   - `nproc`;
   - the memory limit and use: the cgroup's `memory.max`, `memory.current`, `memory.events` and
     `memory.stat` (cgroup v1: `memory.limit_in_bytes`, `memory.usage_in_bytes`, `memory.stat`),
     or `/proc/meminfo` where there is no cgroup limit;
   - `df -B1` and the filesystem type (`df -T`) of the clone's directory and of every scratch
     directory you use.

   **Stop with escalation E-RES**, quoting the numbers, if the clone's filesystem has less than
   **12 GiB free**, or the memory headroom is below **4 GiB**. Do not try to make room by copying,
   moving or deduplicating dependency trees.
   - **When the disk floor applies.** The 12 GiB floor applies at this initial preflight, which
     covers everything after it, the toolchain included. If you install the toolchain after it,
     you may re-check before `lake exe cache get`; that re-check's floor is **8 GiB** (the
     packages about 6 GiB, the cache archives about 1 GiB, the bootstrap's oleans and the clone).
     After the cache step, disk is not re-checked: an ENOSPC is handled by item 4.
   - **The memory headroom is the limit minus the memory in use**, where the memory in use is
     `anon + kernel + shmem` from `memory.stat` (cgroup v1: `memory.usage_in_bytes − total_cache +
     total_shmem`). Where `memory.max` is `max` (no cgroup limit), the headroom is `MemAvailable`
     from `/proc/meminfo`. Log the fields and the computation.
   - **Not shortages:** page cache (`file`, `active_file`, `inactive_file`, `file_mapped` in
     `memory.stat`; `memory.current` includes it), and `memory.events`' `max` and `high` counters,
     which count reclaim at the limit. The kernel reclaims the cache as Lean needs memory.
   - **A shortage** is an `oom` or `oom_kill` event, a Lean exit 137, or a headroom below 4 GiB
     as computed here.
   - **Measured needs at this pin:** the Mathlib cache is about 5.2 GiB unpacked (all packages, with
     their git checkouts, about 6 GiB), plus about 1 GiB of archives kept by the cache tool; the
     toolchain about 4.2 GiB with its archive. The TCSlib bootstrap writes about 0.2–0.3 GB of
     oleans. Lean's peak memory is about 2.8 GiB (`Build/Catalog`, at `-j4`; 2,796 MiB measured on a
     fill host); most modules need under 1.6 GB.
2. **One checkout, one cache.** Do everything in a single clone.
   - **Fetch the cache for your brief's Mathlib roots only**, into that clone's own
     `.lake/packages`, with `TAR_OPTIONS=--no-same-owner` in its environment (extract the
     toolchain archive the same way if it fails on ownership). The roots are the Mathlib modules
     that the modules of your brief's order list import directly; from the clone's root, after
     your brief's first edit (its imports or overlay, if any):

     ```sh
     ORDER=<your brief's order list>
     sed 's|$|.lean|' "$ORDER" | xargs grep -h '^import Mathlib' | awk '{print $2}' | sort -u \
       > evidence/logs/mathlib-roots.txt
     TAR_OPTIONS=--no-same-owner lake exe cache get $(cat evidence/logs/mathlib-roots.txt) \
       2>&1 | tee evidence/logs/cache-get.log
     ```

     The tool fetches those modules and everything they import. **Never run the unfiltered
     `lake exe cache get`.** Record the roots' count and the number of files fetched. If you add
     an import later (only where your brief authorizes one), fetch for the new roots the same way.
     Alternatively, symlink `.lake/packages` to a populated tree at exactly the same pins,
     recorded in `REPORT.md`.
   - **Log the cache tool's archive store first** (v2.5). Before the first `lake exe cache get`,
     record in `evidence/logs/cache-store.log` whether the store exists
     (`${XDG_CACHE_HOME:-$HOME/.cache}/mathlib` by default), how many files it holds and their
     total size (`find … -type f | wc -l`, `du -sb …`). The fetch log's "Attempting to download N"
     and "Decompressing M" then show that `M − N` archives were already in the store. Archives
     already there are the cache tool's own, named by hash and checked by it: using them is
     allowed, and the store is not "another session's object store" (below). In `REPORT.md`, give
     their number and, if you know it, their origin (an earlier session on this host, the host
     image); do not describe them as downloaded by this session.
   - Never copy, move, merge or deduplicate dependency trees between directories.
   - Never reuse another session's scratch tree, package builds, toolchain or object store, and
     never join `LEAN_PATH`s across trees.
   - Never put the clone, `.lake`, the cache, an olean tree (`TCSLIB_OLEANS`) or `TMPDIR` on a
     memory-backed filesystem (`/dev/shm`, any tmpfs).
   - **The cache tool's own work is outside the one-Lean rule.** `lake exe cache get` may first
     compile the cache executable (on a fresh clone, about 20 Lake jobs, among them a few
     Batteries modules) and runs `lake build --no-build proofwidgets:release`. Lake schedules
     these jobs itself, and at this pin it has no option to serialize them. They are expected and
     allowed. They are not a `lake build` of the project, and they are not "a Lean process" in the
     sense of Part 3, item 5. Run the command alone: start no check of your own until it has
     exited. Do not reconstruct, measure or certify Lake's internal scheduling, and do not report
     it as a deviation.
   - **Packages match the manifest** (v2.5: the packages present). A fresh clone's first
     `lake exe cache get …` fetches the packages that `lake-manifest.json` names, except those the
     narrowed fetch does not need. Afterwards, and before every later Lake command, check each
     package **present in** `.lake/packages`: `git -C .lake/packages/<name> remote get-url origin`
     and `rev-parse HEAD` must equal the manifest's URL and revision. If one differs, stop with
     E-RES. List the manifest's packages that were not cloned as **ABSENT**, not as a mismatch (at
     this pin `doc-gen4`, `UnicodeBasic`, `BibtexQuery` and `MD4Lean`, the documentation
     toolchain). The check passes when every present package matches and no module of your order
     list imports an absent package; quote its last line in `REPORT.md`. Never let Lake re-clone
     or update a package that is already present.
3. **Check the cache before the bootstrap.**
   - The narrowed `lake exe cache get` exited 0, with no failed download.
   - `find .lake/packages -name '*.olean' -size 0` prints nothing.
   - A probe that imports one of your roots elaborates through `scripts/lean_check_tree.sh`, e.g.
     a file containing only the first line of `mathlib-roots.txt` as an `import`. A probe that
     imports no Mathlib does not test the cache, and a module outside your roots' closure is not
     in your cache.
   - **Failed downloads** (a network error such as a proxy `403`, or `N download(s) failed`):
     re-run the same narrowed command up to twice; it fetches only what is missing. If files
     still fail, that is a failed check of this item (item 4).
4. **One cleaned retry, then stop.** Clean and retry once on any of these:
   - ENOSPC (`No space left on device`, `os error 28`);
   - `leantar` exit 101;
   - Lean exit 135 (SIGBUS), 137 (killed) or 139 (SIGSEGV);
   - `compiled configuration is invalid`;
   - a failed check of item 3.

   To clean, delete the clone's `.lake/packages` and its compiled configurations
   (`.lake/lakefile.olean*`), re-run the preflight (a re-check: item 1's floor before the cache),
   and run the narrowed `lake exe cache get` once more. If anything fails again, stop with E-RES
   and report, naming the files that failed to download and the roots you fetched. **Never**
   unpack or restore individual archives or oleans by hand (`leantar`, the cache tool's `lookup`,
   copies from elsewhere).
5. **Bootstrap order.** Your brief's order list is the bootstrap. You may build, first, only the
   modules of the list that your owned file imports (directly or not), in the list's order, and
   check your owned file against them. Build the list's remaining modules before the final
   sweep. Record which you did.
6. **No self-imposed timeouts.** Do not wrap module checks in short timeouts.
   - Log each module's start and end time, and its maximum memory (`/usr/bin/time -v` where
     available).
   - A module that stalls far beyond the measured figures is a resource symptom: re-read the
     memory counters, and compute the headroom as in item 1 (the memory in use, not
     `memory.current`). Stop with E-RES only on a shortage as item 1 defines it.
7. **Logs in place.** Write every log to its final path under `evidence/logs/` from the start
   (`2>&1 | tee …`). Never move a log that a running process is writing.
8. **No checks against missing prerequisites.** If the bootstrap stops, record its tail and skip
   the checks that need its products. Do not report their failures as findings.

E-RES is an environment report, not a failed fill. A continuation goes to a host that passes the
preflight.

## Part 2: starting Lean when `/proc/<pid>/exe` is unreadable (v1, unchanged)

**Authorized by the user (2026-10-14) for every fill brief of the chapters 3–4 campaign.** It
applies only under the condition below.

### The condition

Some fill hosts cannot resolve a process's own `/proc/<pid>/exe` link: `/proc/self/exe` may be
readable while `/proc/<pid>/exe` returns *Permission denied*. Lean 4.25.0 locates its own
installation through that link (`IO.appDir`, used by `Lean.getBuildDir`), so `lean --version`,
`lake exe cache get` and `scripts/lean_check_tree.sh` fail with

```text
error: failed to locate application
```

or Lake reports `could not detect the configuration of the Lake installation`.

### The authorized fallback

**Use this only if, and after,** the pinned, unmodified Lean fails with that error in your
environment. Then you may preload the following `readlink` fallback into the Lean and Lake
processes only.

- **What it does:** it answers the single failed self-path lookup with the executable's own path,
  taken from the ELF startup metadata (`AT_EXECFN`). Every other call is passed through
  unchanged.
- **What it does not do:** it changes no filesystem permission, does not bypass the sandbox, and
  changes neither Lean, the kernel, the sources nor any proof check.
- **Precedent:** earlier campaign deliveries used exactly this source, for example the
  record-table continuation 5 (`audits/wave1-fill-agent-reports/recordtable-6-REPORT.md`).

`executable-path.c` (SHA-256 `985924ad83d39e108c0a2107bab07e65cdeb88641453508ab5acda115534fba7`):

```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <dlfcn.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/auxv.h>
#include <unistd.h>
/* Supply the executable's actual path from ELF startup metadata when procfs
   cannot resolve it. No filesystem, network, or proof-checking rules change. */
ssize_t readlink(const char *path, char *buf, size_t cap) {
  static ssize_t (*real_readlink)(const char *, char *, size_t);
  if (!real_readlink) real_readlink = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "readlink");
  ssize_t n = real_readlink(path, buf, cap);
  char own[64];
  snprintf(own, sizeof own, "/proc/%ld/exe", (long)getpid());
  if (n >= 0 || (strcmp(path, "/proc/self/exe") && strcmp(path, own))) return n;
  const char *exe = (const char *)getauxval(AT_EXECFN);
  char absolute[PATH_MAX];
  if (!exe || !realpath(exe, absolute)) return n;
  size_t len = strlen(absolute);
  if (len > cap) len = cap;
  memcpy(buf, absolute, len);
  return (ssize_t)len;
}
```

Compile and use it in your scratch directory:

```bash
cc -shared -fPIC -O2 executable-path.c -ldl -o executable-path.so
export LEAN_SYSROOT="$HOME/.elan/toolchains/leanprover--lean4---v4.25.0"   # your pinned toolchain
export LAKE_HOME="$LEAN_SYSROOT"
export LD_PRELOAD="$PWD/executable-path.so"
lean --version   # must now print the pinned version
```

### Rules

1. **Use exactly this source.** Do not write a different shim, patch the toolchain, change
   permissions or request sandbox escalation.
2. **Scope:** preload it only into the processes that run Lean or Lake (`lake exe cache get`,
   `scripts/lean_check_tree.sh`, your probes). Nothing else.
3. **Record it in `REPORT.md`:**
   - that the condition occurred;
   - the shim's SHA-256, which must match the one above;
   - the exact environment variables you set.

   Include the source under `evidence/runtime/`. **Do not ship the compiled `.so`** or any
   build products.
4. **If Lean still cannot start** with the shim, stop and report. Do not try anything further.
5. A standard host, where Lean starts normally, needs none of this. Do not preload the shim
   there.

## Part 3: the megafill (v2.4)

A **megafill** is one session that works through a queue of fill briefs, one after another, on one
host. Its **cover brief** names the queue, the shared base, the order and each item's budget.
**Each item stays its own fill:** its own brief (binding for that item), branch, checks, screens,
`REPORT.md` and zip, exactly as if it had been dispatched alone. Only the environment work is
shared.

1. **Once, at the start:** Part 1's preflight (item 1, with its floors), the toolchain, and one
   clone of the campaign branch. Verify the cover brief's and every item brief's SHA-256 against
   the cover brief's table, and run the cover brief's ancestor check.
2. **One cache for the queue.** The roots are the union over the queue: run item 2's command with
   every item's order list concatenated, from the clone's root at the shared base:

   ```sh
   cat <every item's order list> | sort -u | sed 's|$|.lean|' | xargs grep -h '^import Mathlib' \
     | awk '{print $2}' | sort -u > evidence/logs/mathlib-roots.txt
   ```

   then `TAR_OPTIONS=--no-same-owner lake exe cache get $(cat evidence/logs/mathlib-roots.txt)`,
   after logging the archive store once (Part 1, item 2). The cover brief gives the expected
   count. Items 3 and 4 apply once, to this fetch. Keep these
   shared logs under `evidence/logs/` at the clone's root, and copy them into each item's zip.
3. **Per item, in the queue's order:**
   1. Start from a clean tree (the previous item's work is committed on its own branch and
      zipped). `git checkout -b <the item's branch> <the shared base>`; apply the item brief's
      patches if it prescribes any; then make its first edit (its authorized imports or overlay).
   2. **Re-bootstrap the item's whole order list**, even the modules an earlier item built: a
      branch switch changes the sources the earlier oleans came from (an earlier item's owned file
      may be upstream of this one). Log it as the item's bootstrap. About 10–20 minutes.
   3. Do the item as its brief says, through its delivery zip, and **deliver that zip at once**.
      The session may end at any time; finished items must survive it.
   4. **Budget.** Each item has a wall-clock budget, counted from its branch's creation. When it
      runs out, finish the step in progress, commit, write the item's partial zip with its
      `REPORT.md` (the checkpoints reached; every open declaration with its literal "Proof
      sketch"; the axiom walk), and start the next item. Time an item does not use passes to the
      later ones. The last item has the rest of the session. **Never return to an earlier item.**
   5. **Escalations stay per item** (each brief's ground rules). An item with nothing left that
      its escalations allow ends early, with its zip.
4. **Disk between items.** Before each item after the first, record `df -B1` of the clone. Stop the
   whole queue with E-RES below **3 GiB** free; the items already zipped stand.
5. **One Lean process at a time** across the whole queue, and one screen at a time. A Lean
   process is one that you start: a module check, a probe, a bootstrap or sweep step (each
   through `scripts/lean_check_tree.sh`), or one `lake exe cache get`. Never run two of them at
   once. One text screen (Python, `nice -n 10`) may run beside one of them. Processes that Lake or
   the cache tool start inside `lake exe cache get` are not counted.
6. **At the end** (or when the session must stop), deliver `megafill-<name>-REPORT.md`: the queue;
   each item's outcome (complete; partial, with its checkpoints; or not started), with its
   branch's start and end times and its zip's SHA-256; the shared preflight and cache numbers. An
   item never started is simply listed as such: it is not a failure.
7. **A process deviation never ends an item.** A deviation from these rules, yours or a tool's, is
   disclosed in `REPORT.md` with its evidence, and the work continues: stopping does not undo it.
   Only E-RES (Part 1) or an item brief's own escalation (its ground rules) ends an item early.
