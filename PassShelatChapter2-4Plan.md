# Pass–shelat, *A Course in Cryptography*, Chapters 2–4

Status: **frozen** (2026-10-27, after the run-1 design panel). Frozen signatures live in
`briefs/pass-shelat/DESIGN.md` (§2) and compiled in `briefs/pass-shelat/DESIGN-freeze-scratch.lean`;
the per-item inventories are `briefs/pass-shelat/inventory-ch{2,3,4}.md`.

## Objective and source

Formalize Chapters 2–4 of [PS10] R. Pass, a. shelat, *A Course in Cryptography*, lecture notes,
3rd edition, January 2010 (pdftotext under `blueprint/src/references/pass-shelat-2010-ch{2,3,4}.raw.md`):

* Chapter 2, *Computational Hardness*: efficient (randomized, non-uniform) computation; worst-case,
  strong and weak one-way functions; factoring and `f_mult`; hardness amplification; collections of
  one-way functions; computational number theory; the factoring, discrete-log, RSA and Rabin
  collections; one-way and trapdoor permutations; Levin's universal one-way function.
* Chapter 3, *Indistinguishability & Pseudo-Randomness*: ensembles and computational
  indistinguishability (closure, hybrid lemma, prediction lemma); pseudorandom ensembles and the
  next-bit test; pseudorandom generators and hard-core predicates (PRG from a one-way permutation,
  expansion, Goldreich–Levin); single- and multi-message secure private-key encryption;
  pseudorandom functions (GGM); public-key encryption from trapdoor permutations; El Gamal.
* Chapter 4, *Knowledge*: zero-knowledge encryption; interactive protocols and proofs (graph
  non-isomorphism, graph isomorphism); honest-verifier and general zero-knowledge; commitments;
  zero-knowledge for graph 3-colouring and hence for NP.

The campaign **builds on** the Garg concrete layer (`TCSlib/Cryptography/{Foundations,OneWayFunctions,
HardcoreBit,Pseudorandom}`, every reduction an exact inequality at one security parameter) and on the
Arora–Barak machine library (`TCSlib/Complexity/{TuringMachine,ClassP,ClassNP,CircuitComplexity/Advice}`).
It supplies what the Garg plan called *Phase B, the asymptotic layer*: probabilistic and non-uniform
polynomial-time machines, negligible-advantage definitions, and the textbook theorems derived from the
concrete reductions plus machine-closure facts.

## Foundation decisions (frozen 2026-10-27 by the run-1 design panel)

D1. **Base and branch.** Branch `cryptography/pass-shelat-ch2-4` from `cryptography/garg-ch1-3`;
    worktree `/Users/dehmelf/Research/tcslib-pass-shelat`. Verification by shell
    `lake build <module>` / `lake env lean <file>` (user-approved deviation from `AGENTS.md`),
    one Lean process at a time.

D2. **Two layers, as in the Garg plan.** Concrete reductions are reused verbatim from
    `TCSlib/Cryptography/{Foundations,OneWayFunctions,HardcoreBit,Pseudorandom}`; the
    asymptotic layer adds machines, negligible functions and closure. Every asymptotic theorem
    is proved as (i) instantiate the concrete reduction at each `n`, (ii) exhibit the reduction
    as a `Complexity.NUPPT` by `NUPPT.ofPolyTime` of a function obtained from the FP calculus of
    `ClassNP/PolyTimePairing.lean` with `NUPPT.polyTimeComputable_output` as a black box, plus
    the two new machine lemmas of D11, (iii) negligible-function arithmetic through
    `not_negligible_iff`. New concrete lemmas go into campaign-owned files, never into the
    frozen Garg files.

D3. **Probabilistic machines.** One structure `Complexity.NUPPT` (file
    `TCSlib/Complexity/Randomized/PPT.lean`): a `Turing.FinTM Bool` that halts on **every** input
    `z` within `Ct * (|z| + 1) ^ ct` steps, an explicit coin polynomial `coins : PolyExpr`, an
    advice polynomial `adv : PolyExpr` and an advice function. The single semantic primitive is
    `output z` (the output tape when the budget expires); `output` is `PolyTimeComputable`
    (proved) and every `PolyTimeComputable` function gives an `NUPPT` (`ofPolyTime`, proved).
    A PPT ([PS10, Def 23.4]) is an `NUPPT` with empty advice (`Uniform`; `Complexity.PPT` is the
    subtype). The activation at security parameter `n` on argument `y` with coins `r` is
    `runAt n y r := output ⟨⟨⟨1^n, y⟩, advice n⟩, r⟩` with `r : Fin (coins.eval n) → Bool`; the
    random tape is part of the input, the time bound holds for every coin string
    ([PS10, Def 23.5], worst case), and "`A` computes `f` with probability 1" ([PS10, Def 24.6])
    is `Computes`: equality for every coin string. Honest evaluators ("easy to compute") are
    stated as `PolyTimeComputable` string functions on `⟨1^n, x⟩`. Recorded deviations:
    totality on all inputs (behaviour class unchanged: a machine polynomial-time on well-formed
    inputs is clocked by `timed_universal`; the optional lemma `NUPPT.ofPartial` is not needed
    by any theorem); time measured in the machine-input length (a polynomial in `n + |y|`,
    so the classes coincide); advice and coins indexed by the parameter `n` read from `1^n`
    rather than by the input length (interdefinable in every experiment of the text, and what
    makes one random tape per `n` well-typed for the oracle and interactive layouts).

D4. **Non-uniform PPT** ([PS10, Def 26.8]) in the advice formulation: `advice n` of length
    `≤ adv.eval n`, run on `⟨⟨⟨1^n, y⟩, advice n⟩, r⟩`. The input-length-indexed activation
    `A_{|y|}(y)` of the text is `runLit y r := runAt |y| y r` (the prefix `1^{|y|}` carries no
    information); it is the layout of the literal forms of Def 26.1 and Def 69.4 (D5, D6). The
    machine-sequence formulation (`NUPPTSeq`, with `CodeTM.serialize` size) is an **optional**
    corollary module (`Randomized/Sequence.lean`) with the equivalence
    `nuppt_seq_iff_advice` as one named, non-blocking admission; it is not formalized in the
    core (Deviation recorded in the docstring of `NUPPT`).

D5. **Domains are typed at each parameter.** A function family is
    `FunFamily := ⟨inLen outLen : PolyExpr, f n : (Fin (inLen.eval n) → Bool) → (Fin (outLen.eval n) → Bool)⟩`;
    the textbook `f : {0,1}* → {0,1}*` is `FunFamily.ofString f p` (`inLen = var`). An
    inverter's output is decoded by `decodeFin` as an `inLen n`-bit string and a wrong length is
    a failure (`invProbOpt`, bridged to the concrete `invProb` by `invProbOpt_le_invProb` and
    `invProbOpt_some`). Adversaries receive `1^n` exactly where the text gives it
    (Defs 27.3, 28.4, 75.2, 96.1, …); where the text withholds it (Def 26.1: `A(f(x))`;
    Def 69.4: `D(t)`) the literal definition is kept (`WorstCaseOneWayLit` with
    `inverterLit`, `Ensemble.IndistLit`), and the `1^n` form (`WorstCaseOneWay`,
    `Ensemble.Indist`) is the headline form of the definitions and theorems, related by
    `WorstCaseOneWay.toLit` / `Indist.toLit` (always) and `WorstCaseOneWayLit.toParam` /
    `IndistLit.toIndist` (injective `outLen` / `ℓ`, i.e. every family / ensemble of the text).
    The two are never unified silently. (Run-3 audit P3-2: the literal Def 26.1 is vacuously
    satisfied by length-shrinking families whose output length does not determine `n`, e.g.
    the constant family, an artefact of the typed inverse; hence the `1^n` headline.)

D6. **Ensembles** ([PS10, Def 69.3]) are `Ensemble ℓ := ⟨σ : ℕ → Type, Fintype, X n : σ n → (Fin (ℓ.eval n) → Bool)⟩`
    with arbitrary finite seed types (the uniform ensemble has seeds `Fin (ℓ n) → Bool`, the
    random-function oracle has function tables). "Efficiently samplable" is the predicate
    `Samplable` at the **distribution level**: a polynomial-time sampler from `s.eval n` uniform
    bits whose output law equals `X n` (`StatClose … 0`). Lemma 71.5 is `Indist.push` (image
    under an `NUPPT`, padded to an explicit `ℓ' : PolyExpr`), the multicopy corollary
    `Indist.copies` takes `Samplable X`, `Samplable Y`, and the hybrid lemma is the concrete
    `exists_hybrid_gap`. Deviation: every samplable distribution is dyadic; non-dyadic
    distributions of the text (primes, `Z_q`, permutations) appear only as *ideal* distributions
    in experiments and are approximated by rejection samplers within `StatClose` error (D10).

D7. **Oracle adversaries** ([PS10, Def 96.1]) are next-query machines: an `NUPPT` activated once
    per query on the encoded history of (query, answer) pairs with one random tape per `n`, and
    an explicit query budget `q : PolyExpr` quantified universally in the definition
    (`∀ D q`); `NUPPT.toOracleAdversary n ℓ₁ ℓ₂ (q.eval n)` builds the concrete `QueryTree`
    (`OracleAdversary`), `toOracleAdversary_boundedBy` supplies `BoundedBy q` for
    `ggm_prfAdv_le`/`exists_ggmBits_dist`. No oracle tapes (the library's `OracleTM` is a
    language oracle); the bridge `exists_queryTree` from `OracleTM`-level machines is an optional
    module. Deviation recorded.

D8. **Interactive protocols** ([PS10, §4.4]). A `Strategy` is a next-message function
    `next x z r received` with an explicit random-tape polynomial `coins : PolyExpr`; its value
    on the complete history is the party's output. A `Protocol` is `⟨P, V, rounds, verifierFirst⟩`
    where `rounds : PolyExpr` is the number of messages exchanged and `verifierFirst` the first
    mover (GNI: verifier; GI, 3COL: prover). `exec` is the fixed alternation of
    `rounds.eval |x|` moves; the verifier's verdict is `V.next` on the complete history
    (`outV`), so it is always defined and the literal `out_V = 0` is `outV = [false]`.
    `Strategy.Efficient` = one activation of a uniform `NUPPT` at parameter `|x|` on
    `⟨⟨x, z⟩, messages⟩` with the whole random tape (time polynomial in the total input,
    Deviation from the text's `t(|x|)`). Soundness quantifies `∃ ε` before `∀ x ∉ L ∀ P' ∀ z`
    over arbitrary strategies `P'` (unbounded provers; polynomial coin tapes lose nothing by
    averaging). Zero knowledge: `∀ V* efficient, ∃ S uniform NUPPT, ∀ Lz D, ∃ ε, ∀ x y z`,
    `R x y → |z| ≤ Lz.eval |x| → distAdv ≤ ε |x|` — strict PPT simulators, auxiliary inputs
    bounded by an arbitrary polynomial quantified after the simulator (the class a `t(|x|)`-time
    verifier can read; required for the non-uniform reduction of Prop 128.8). Statistical ZK
    (`StatZK δ`, sup-over-test-sets `StatClose`), `PerfectZK := StatZK 0` and Goldreich's abort
    form `PerfectZKAbort` are stated; GI and 3COL are proved statistically (truncated
    simulators, rejection-sampled permutations). Deviations: fixed number of moves (a halting
    party is modelled as sending `[]`; all protocols of the text are fixed-round), strict
    simulators, statistical instead of perfect ZK, `|z|` polynomially bounded.

D9. **Lengths are syntax.** Every length or budget that depends on the parameter (coins,
    advice, input/output lengths of families and ensembles, stretch, query budgets, rounds,
    auxiliary-input bounds) is a `Complexity.PolyExpr` (`const/var/add/mul/pow`, `eval`,
    `subst`, `eval_subst`, `eval_mono`, `eval_le`, `normal C c = C(n+1)^c`). Time bounds of
    machines stay in the normal form `Ct (n+1)^ct` (the shape of `PolyTimeComputable`).
    `polyTimeComputable_unaryPoly p : x ↦ 1^{p(|x|)}` is proved by induction with the new
    primitive `computesFunInTime_unaryMul`, never through the repetition lemma. Abstract
    `ℕ → ℕ` lengths appear only as hypotheses of theorems with a `PolyExpr` majorant
    (`exists_reparam_advice`), never in a definition.

D10. **Sampling device.** `TCSlib/Cryptography/Asymptotic/Sampling.lean` owns
    `StatClose` (with `distAdv_le_of_statClose`, `StatClose.prod`, `StatClose.map`),
    `rejectionSample m k T` (`T` trials of `k` bits; uniform on `Fin m` conditioned on `some`,
    failure `(1 - m/2^k)^T`) and `permFromCoins` (Fisher–Yates with rejection-sampled offsets).
    Experiments use ideal uniform distributions (as the text); honest parties and reductions
    sample by rejection with `2^{-n}`-close laws and the theorems carry the explicit
    statistical term. This one device serves Theorem 35.1's uniform position (`m = 2nq(n)` is
    kept literal), SamplePrime/`Z_q`/`Z_N^*`/`QR_N` (Q3), and Chapter 4's permutations, edges
    and colour permutations (DQ1 option A at the concrete level).
    D10 relaxes only the *uniformity* of a collection's domain sampler (`SampleClose`); its
    *membership* clause — the sampler returns elements of `D_i` on which the evaluator
    computes `f_i` [PS10, Def 41.1 (2)] — is the structure field `Collection.sample_spec`
    (run-3 audit P3-1; it is what makes Theorem 42.2 (⇒) provable). Every candidate sampler
    satisfies it by the `getD`-default convention (a failed rejection loop outputs a canonical
    default element).

D11. **Admissions policy.** `Complexity.polyTimeComputable_iterateFind`
    (`Randomized/Repetition.lean`) is the single machine lemma that may remain admitted at the
    end of run 4; every theorem that repeats an adversary depends on it and on nothing else
    admitted. The two new primitives (`pairSplitAt`, `unaryMul`) are built in the `Build/`
    style in the campaign-owned `Randomized/Primitives.lean`. `NUPPTSeq`'s equivalence,
    `NUPPT.ofPartial` and `exists_queryTree` are optional modules, each with its own named
    admission, off every critical path. Number-theoretic machine facts (binary `mul`,
    `add`, `sub`, `divMod`, `xgcd`, `modExp`, comparison, bit length, primality; run-3
    audit P7-1 added `add`/`sub`/bit length) are explicit hypotheses
    (`Candidates/Arithmetic.lean` bundle), never axioms; `#print axioms` of every headline must
    show `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` plus, at most, the admissions named here.
    Likewise Theorem 63.1 (`theorem_63_1`, `fUniversal_easy`, `fUniversal_hard`,
    `fUniversal_weakOneWay`) is stated for encoding schemes with an at most exponential
    canonizer (`CanonizerExp c`, canonizer time `≤ A·2^{Bk}`), no instance being proved
    (`exists_canonizerExp` is the recorded open problem; run-3 audit P3-4).

## Errors and gaps in the source to handle

Outright errors (to replace the plan's seeded list):

**Chapter 2.**
1. Algorithm 64.2 / Theorem 63.1: `f_universal(⟨M, x⟩) = M(x)` omits the machine description
   from the output; the proof is invalid. Corrected definition outputs `⟨M, M(x)⟩`.
2. §2.6.5, `L_N`: "`N = u2^j`" should be `N − 1 = u·2^j`; the condition stated with `i = j`
   only is vacuous; intended `∀ i < j, α^{u2^{i+1}} = 1 → α^{u2^i} = ±1`.
3. Claim 32.4 is false as a strict inequality (`x = 1, p = 2`); correct form
   `p^{ν_p(C(2x,x))} ≤ 2x` (`Nat.pow_factorization_choose_le`).
4. §2.6.6 (p. 50): prime probability "exceeds `1/n`"; Theorem 31.3 gives `1/(2n)`.
5. Theorems 60.5, 61.7, 61.8, 63.10 and Corollary 60.6 need `p ≠ q` odd primes (`Π_n` contains
   2 and allows `p = q`); `Φ(pq) = (p−1)(q−1)` (p. 47) and Assumption 53.1 need `p ≠ q`.
6. Theorem 61.8 (⇐) needs square roots modulo arbitrary primes; only `p ≡ 3 (mod 4)` is proved
   (Theorem 58.2); Theorem 63.10's `Gen` needs the density of primes `≡ 3 (mod 4)` (not in
   Mathlib; explicit hypothesis).
7. Theorem 59.4: "`zinQRq`" typo; the `⇒`/`⇐` labels of the proof are swapped.
8. Theorem 52.3: `R_i = G_p`, `f_{p,g}` should be `G_q`, `f_{q,g}`; Assumption 52.2 gives `A`
   only `g^x` (needs `q, g`); `G_q` unspecified.
9. Theorem 53.2's proof samples `e ← Z_N^*` (should be `Z*_{Φ(N)}`).
10. Definition 56.1(5): `≤ e(k)` should be `e(n)`.
11. Definition 41.1(4): "p.p.t. `A`" contradicts the nuPPT convention; `f(A(1^n, i, y)) = y`
    should read `f_i`; `R_i` unconstrained; `D_i` must be finite.
12. Theorem 42.2 proof idea: "`I = {0}`, `D_0 = ℕ`" — the domain must depend on `n`.
13. §2.4.3 proof: "for each `j ∈ [1, n]`" should be `[1, m]`; the bound chain with the extra
    factor `m` is garbled.
14. Algorithm 33.6 line 7: `A(1^n, z′)` should be `A(1^{2n}, z′)`; Algorithm 37.4 must output a
    verified factor.
15. Lemma 189.8 garbled ("`1 − 2??`"), proof unfinished; Theorem 188.7's threshold `ε` should be `εn`.
16. §2.3 attack `A(z) = (2, z/2)` returns a preimage of a different input length.
17. Claim 43.3 case 2: "`b > 2^n`" should be `b ≥ 2^n`; the precondition allows `b = 0`.
18. p. 61 example `N = 77`: numbers garbled.
19. Theorem 63.1 proof: "hardness amplification from §2.3" should be §2.4; budget `|y|^3`
    becomes `(|y|+1)^3`.
20. Theorem 49.14: "with probability `1 − 2^{−t}`" should be "at least"; Lemma 50.15: "`N > 2`
    composite" should be odd composite.
21. p. 27: "NP ⊄ BPP ⟺ worst-case OWFs exist" mixes uniform BPP with non-uniform inverters.
22. Theorem 45.6 / p. 46: the remark that Euler's theorem "removes the restriction `x < N`"
    refers to a restriction Algorithm 45.5 does not have.
23. Theorem 31.3 proof: "each term is greater than 2" — the term `(x+x)/x` equals 2.
24. Theorems 61.8 / 55.2 mix `n` and `k`; Theorem 61.7 writes `Z_n^*`; Theorem 51.1's `D_i`
    uses exactly-`i/2`-bit primes while Assumption 30.1 uses `Π_n`.
25. Theorem 35.1's `m = 2nq(n)` is kept, but the uniform position of Algorithm 38.5 is not
    exactly samplable by a bit-coin PPT unless `m` is a power of two (D10).

**Chapter 3.**
26. Theorem 87.3 says `⟨x, r⟩` is hard-core "for `f`"; it is for `g(x, r) = (f(x), r)`.
27. Lemma 84.1 vs Assumption 52.2: the assumption is for prime-order `G_q`, the lemma and
    Algorithm 84.2 use `Z_p^*` (even order); `x ← Z_p` should be `x ← Z_{p−1}`; "`ε = s(n)`"
    should be `1/s(n)`; the range reduction "as we will show later" is never shown; the
    good-instance averaging over `(p, g)` is missing; the p. 86 analysis bounds
    `Pr[noinc | low]` by `1/2 − ε/2`, the complementary event of its own increment rule (`lo`
    counts disagreements `b_i ≠ half(r_i)`). (Run-3 audit P8-3: line 11's root selection is
    consistent with `half`'s convention, and the strict `half_m(x) := [2x < m]` of the
    formalization is a harmless variant, not needed by the halving invariant.)
28. Theorem 107.3 / Algorithm 106.2: El Gamal with `m ∈ Z_p^*` is insecure under DDH on `G_q`
    (Legendre symbol of `c_2`); correct with message space `G_q`; `Gen` draws `g ∈ Z_p` (may be
    `0, ±1`); the square-vs-generator sampling term `1/q` is missing.
29. Definition 75.2 quantifies `i ∈ [0, ℓ(n)]` (bit `t_{ℓ(n)+1}` does not exist).
30. Definition 78.3 mixes `k` and `n`.
31. Definition 96.1: `{O'_n} ≈ {O'_n}` typo.
32. Theorem 104.4 omits the hard-core bit from its hypothesis; its proof writes `D` for `A`.
33. Algorithm 76.5 draws `U_{ℓ(n)−1}` (should be `U_{ℓ(n)−i}`); Theorem 75.4's proof defines
    `H̃^i` with a stray `u_{l(m)}`, mixes 0/1-indexing, and its last display has `A(t) = 1` for
    `A(t) = b`.
34. Lemma 80.5's proof: `m(n)`/`ℓ(n)` interchanged; hybrids must start at `i = 0`; `M(y)` reads
    bit-then-seed against the construction's seed-then-bit.
35. Theorem 99.2's collision bound `C(q(n), 2) 2^{−n}` should be `C(q(n)+1, 2) 2^{−n}`.
36. Theorem 92.2's proof: hybrid `H²` mislabelled ("`m_1`"); gap `1/(3p(n))`, not `1/(4p(n))`.
37. Theorem 87.3's final constant: text `ε^3/(32n)` (with `ε' = ε/2`) versus the concrete
    layer's stronger `ε^3/(16n)` (the plan's seeded `ε^3/(4n)` note compares `ε'` with `ε`).
38. Lemma 71.6: the proof gives `ε/(m−1)`, the statement `ε/m` (harmless); Corollary 81.7 lists
    `ℓ(n)+1` bits.

**Chapter 4.**
39. Proposition 120.7 says "for `L_niso`"; it is for `L_iso`; its proof reverses the maps
    (`π(H) = G1`, `σ(π(H))`) and renames the graphs.
40. Definition 126.3, binding: omits `v₀ ≠ v₁`; as printed unsatisfiable.
41. Proposition 127.6's proof: "repeated `|E|^2` times" vs the protocol's `n|E|`.
42. Protocol 127.5: witness listed as `c_0 … c_m` (should be `c_1 … c_n`); Simulator 128.7:
    "`k ∈ [m] \ {i', j'}`" should be `[n]`.
43. Protocol 127.5's verifier "accepts iff `c'_i ≠ c'_j`" without checking the openings — unsound;
    undefined for `E = ∅`; `Com` on 2-bit colours has security parameter 2 (pad to `n`).
44. Theorem 122.3 claims perfect ZK for the `n`-iteration protocol; the proof covers one
    iteration and relies on §7.2.1; with bit-coin parties perfect completeness and perfect ZK
    cannot both be literal (`n!` is not dyadic); same for Protocol 118.3's `σ` and 127.5's
    colour permutation.
45. Definitions 121.1/121.2 and Proposition 128.8 bound by `e(n)` with `n` undefined
    (`n = |x|`); Definition 121.2 relies on expected polynomial time.
46. Proposition 128.8's proof: hybrid count `2n|E|` vs `n|E|` attempts; "`S̃_{e+1}` … `S̃_{e+1}`"
    typo; the `6|E|` sub-hybrid is unnecessary.
47. §4.7 step 2: "Cook's reduction applied to the witness" needs a Levin reduction (never
    defined); "execute `(P, V)` on `x'`" should be `(P', V')`; Theorem 126.4 needs a hard-core
    predicate (Theorem 87.3) and uses a single OWP, not Definition 55.1's collection.
48. Appendix B, Definition 191.11: "`R_L(x) = {y : (x, y) ∈ L}`" should be `∈ R_L`.
49. Proposition 118.4's proof uses `G1, G2` for `G0, G1`; "the prover runs in exponential time"
    is only an upper bound; the adaptive-prover argument is hidden.
50. §4.4: a round ends when the active machine *halts* ("the protocol ends"), which makes the
    literal `Pr[out_V = 0]` of Definition 116.1 unsatisfiable against a prover that halts at
    once; time complexity `t(|x|)` "regardless of messages" leaves the simulator's call to `V*`
    on long `z` ill-defined (D8 reading).

Gaps the formalization fills (not errors): Theorem 42.2 (⇒) and Theorem 57.2 ("exercises");
the PKE single ⇒ multi-message theorem and the bitwise theorem (p. 103); Theorem 107.3
("exercise") with the `1/q` term; Lemma 84.1's range reduction and averaging; the square-root
algorithm for `p ≡ 1 (mod 4)` (restricted to `3 (mod 4)` instead); Miller–Rabin's composite
case (deferred); Chernoff (replaced by Chebyshev for pairwise independence); Theorem 112.2's
message sampler (`0^n`); Theorem 124.1's string-level Levin reduction to 3COL (hypothesis).

## Architecture, module layout and workstreams

Every **core** item of the three inventories appears exactly once (68 + 82 + 69 = 219 ids).
Optional/deferred items are listed in §6.2 for information. Paths are relative to the
worktree. New files not in the plan's layout are marked (new).

### 6.1 Build order (run 2 statement phase)

1. **M1** (serial; everything imports it) — then **M2 and M3 statements** (serial; their fills
   are the machine agent's run-4 work and may lag).
2. **S** (small; concrete) in parallel with the statement skeletons of **C2a, C3a, C4a, NT**.
3. **C2b, C3b, C4b, Cand1, C2c**.
4. **C3c, C3d, C4c, Cand2**.
5. **C3e, C3f, Cand3, C4d**.
6. **A** after each workstream lands (append its `#print axioms` lines) and at closure.

Fill-phase critical path: `pairSplitAt` → `unaryMul` → `Closure.lean` → `iterateFind`
→ {Thm 35.1, `Indist.copies`, GL, GGM, GI/3COL simulators} in parallel.

## Phasing

1. **Run 1 — understand and design**: per-chapter inventories mapped to existing declarations; a
   judged design panel for D3/D4/D6/D8; synthesis into this plan.
2. **Run 2 — statement phase**: the machine layer first (serial, it is a dependency), then parallel
   skeletons per workstream, every proof a `sorry` under a sketch, compiling.
3. **Run 3 — adversarial statement audit**: independent auditors compare every statement blind against
   the source; blockers/majors repaired before any fill.
4. **Run 4 — fill campaign**: sorry-ladder fills with disjoint file ownership, loop until dry.
5. **Run 5 — closure**: full build, sorry census, axiom prints (`audits/pass-shelat/Checks.lean`),
   lint, completion record, commit.

## Risks and honest effort assessment

* The machine-closure lemma "polynomially many fresh-coin calls" (Repetition) is the load-bearing
  infrastructure; it was closed in run 3b (2026-10-28) as an instance of
  `Turing.FinTM.exists_loopFindTM` with clean-call modules, so no theorem of the campaign depends on a
  machine-level admission.
* Chebyshev's bound and Miller–Rabin's composite-case lemma are genuine number theory not in Mathlib.
* Chapter 4's protocol model is new; keep it small and concrete (next-message functions, bounded rounds).
* Theorem 124.1 (ZK for NP) needs a polynomial-time *string* reduction from `SAT3` to 3-colouring; the
  repository's reduction is graph-level. The theorem is stated with NP-hardness of 3COL as an explicit
  hypothesis if the string reduction is not closed.

## Decision log

| Date | Decision | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-27 | Campaign opened on `cryptography/pass-shelat-ch2-4` from `cryptography/garg-ch1-3`; shell `lake build <module>` is the verification path | active |
| 2026-10-27 | D2–D8 adopted provisionally pending the run-1 design panel | superseded by the row below |
| 2026-10-27 | Run-1 design panel (3 designs, 3 judges, synthesis): REUSE-MAXIMAL adopted with the judges' repairs; D1–D11 frozen as above; frozen signatures in `briefs/pass-shelat/DESIGN.md` §2 (compiled scratch: 0 errors, 53 sorried stubs) | active |
| 2026-10-27 | Open question 1 (conditional candidates): accepted — every number-theoretic candidate theorem is stated under the explicit polynomial-time arithmetic hypothesis bundle `Candidates/Arithmetic.lean`; the arithmetic machines are not funded in this campaign | active |
| 2026-10-27 | Open question 2 (Theorem 124.1): form (A) is the headline — ZK for every `(L, R_L)` with an explicit Levin reduction to 3COL as hypothesis; the "every `L ∈ NP`" form is stated as a corollary under an NP-hardness-with-Levin-reductions hypothesis for 3COL | active |
| 2026-10-27 | Open question 3 (Rabin/RSA scope): accepted — `p ≠ q`, Blum integers for Rabin, density of primes `≡ 3 (mod 4)` as an explicit hypothesis of Theorem 63.10's `Gen` clause; Lemma 84.1's generator restricted to `p ≡ 3 (mod 4)` | active |
| 2026-10-27 | Open question 4 (Lemma 84.1): the concrete statement is core; the asymptotic wrapper may remain sorried under its sketch if the fill stalls, and is then listed as a named admission | active |
| 2026-10-27 | Open question 5 (optional literal modules `NUPPTSeq`, `exists_queryTree`, `NUPPT.ofPartial`): outside the mandatory core | active |
| 2026-10-28 | Run 2 (statement phase, 21 agents): 52 campaign files, 21 546 lines, full `lake build` 0 errors, 157 sorried statement stubs, `style_lint` clean on every file; machine layer passed its adversarial verification (8 findings, 0 blocker/major); every core inventory id stated (integrator census `audits/pass-shelat/run2-census.md`, axiom prints `run2-axioms.log`: 101 headline/sanity declarations closed, 142 depend on `sorryAx`). Facades exported from `TCSlib.lean`; `Complexity.NUPPT` registered in `ComputationalModels.lean` | active |
| 2026-10-28 | Statement-level issues carried into the run-3 audit: Thm 42.2 (⇒) unprovable from the frozen `Collection` fields (C2b); permutation sampler parameters (`permFromCoins n n n`) cannot give negligible failure, C4b used `Nat.size n` bits and `n²` trials locally; GI/3COL verifiers gained `wellFormedInstance`; `Arithmetic` bundle lacks add/sub/bit-length; Lemma 50.15b deferred | active |
| 2026-10-28 | Run 3a (adversarial statement audit, 10 packs + sequential repairs + recheck) and run 3b (machine-layer fills: `pairSplitAt`, `unaryMul`, `iterateFind` with continuations, instances, verifier) launched in parallel | active |
| 2026-10-28 | Run 3a pack P3 (oneway-collections-universal) repairs: **P3-1** `Collection` gains the field `sample_spec` (membership half of Def 41.1 (2)); `Collection.EvalSampled` is derived (`evalSampled`); Thm 42.2 (⇒) `exists_strongOneWay` proved from `owfFamily_strongOneWay` (hypothesis `hG` dropped); instances discharge it (`toCollection`, `factoringCollection` with the canonical default pair `samplePairOut`, `Collection.glPad m henc` now taking `henc`, candidates RSA/Rabin/Blum/exp by sorried `*Sampler_spec` stubs); `expCollection H G hV` takes the validity bridge and its generator outputs the fixed valid `dlDefaultIndex` below `n₀`; `tdpBitScheme` drops `hS`. **P3-2** Def 26.1: the `1^n` form `WorstCaseOneWay` is the headline, the literal form is `WorstCaseOneWayLit`, bridges `toLit` (always) / `toParam` (injective `outLen`) proved. **P3-3** `lemma_64_3` sketch: `𝓖 := ⟨var, 2·var, g'⟩`. **P3-4** `CanonizerExp` ratified as an explicit hypothesis (D11), open problem `exists_canonizerExp`. **P3-5** literal `Inv((i, t), y)` not adopted; Deviation recorded on `TrapdoorCollection`, `rsaGen`, `blumGen` | active |
| 2026-10-28 | Run 3b (machine-layer fills, 5 agents): `computesFunInTime_pairSplitAt` (`Build/PairSplit.lean`), `computesFunInTime_unaryMul` (`Build/UnaryMul.lean`), `polyTimeComputable_iterateFind` (`Build/IterateFindHost.lean` + `Build/IterateFind.lean`, instance of `exists_loopFindTM` with clean-call modules and a fresh anchor), and the six instances (`Build/StateLoop.lean`, `Build/StringLoops.lean`) all proved; every frozen machine-layer statement unchanged (56/56 identical to the freeze); `#print axioms` of all 18 targets = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (`audits/pass-shelat/run3b-machine-axioms.log`). **D11's permitted admission is no longer needed**; the only remaining machine-layer sorry is the optional bridge `NUPPT.decides_of_decidesWithAdviceInTime` | active |
| 2026-10-28 | Run 3a (adversarial statement audit, 10 packs P2–P11, 19 agents): 30 findings — 2 blockers (P8-1 DDH ensembles, P11-1 3COL), 12 majors, 16 minors; 28 repaired, 0 rebutted, 2 minors deferred (P5-1 GGM sketch wording, P6-1 Lemma 50.15 oddness); all 14 blocker/major dispositions re-verified by the re-checker; full build 0 errors, 61 files / 27 291 lines, 149 sorries, lint clean (`audits/pass-shelat/run3-audit-summary.md`, `run3-axioms.log`). Statement changes recorded in docstrings ("Repair (run-3 audit …)") and in the summary; notable: `Collection.sample_spec` field (Thm 42.2 ⇒ now proved from it), `WorstCaseOneWay` in `1^n` form with the literal `WorstCaseOneWayLit` and bridges, `Ensemble` nonemptiness field, permutation sampler at `permBits n = Nat.size n`, `permTrials n = 2n²` (`Asymptotic/Permutations.lean`), `HardCorePermutation.lean` (`PermFamily.glHalf`), `CanonizerExp` ratified as a recorded open problem (`exists_canonizerExp`). **Gate status:** this was an *internal* adversarial audit in fresh contexts, not the different-vendor external audit of `workflow.md` §3; the external gate remains to be conducted | active |
| 2026-10-28 | Run 4 (fill campaign) launched: 25 disjoint file groups, up to three rounds each, five concurrent, statement freeze binding (unprovable-as-stated targets are escalated, never re-stated), closure integrator writes `audits/pass-shelat/run4-census.md` and `run4-axioms.log` | active |
| 2026-10-28 | Run 4 stopped by the maintainer before completion (workflow `wf_437529a0-0bf`; 23 fill groups, not the 25 logged at launch). State at stop, from a text census that Lean has not confirmed: 63 sorried declarations left, of which 57 are in `Candidates/*` (their fill groups appear never to have started), 2 in the Universal files, 3 in `ThreeColoring/{Protocol,Simulator}`, 1 optional bridge in `NonUniform`; the full build FAILS on duplicate helper names (`zipWith_xor_ofFn` in `Asymptotic/Encryption.lean` and `Asymptotic/HardCoreLoops.lean`; `zipWith_xor_ofFn_eq_add` in `MultiMessage.lean` and `MultiMessageLemmas.lean` unconfirmed); no closure census, no axiom log, nothing committed | active |
