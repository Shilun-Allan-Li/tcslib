# Formalization Plan: Arora-Barak Chapters 3-4 — Diagonalization and Space Complexity

**Status: draft for maintainer review (2026-10-08).** Nothing below is decided until the
open questions in §7 are answered; the decision log (§8) records every row as *Proposed*.

Continuation of the Arora-Barak campaign (`AroraBarakChapter1Plan.md`,
`AroraBarakChapter2Plan.md`, both closed), now working from `main`: branch
`complexity/arora-barak-ch3-4`, created from `origin/main` at `99b187fc`. The methodology
is unchanged (`workflow.md`): audited statement phases with proof sketches,
cross-vendor LLM audit gates closing on zero blockers/majors, then fill epochs of
disjoint-ownership batches with zip delivery, drift attestations, and a blueprint
increment at closure. Artifact names: `audits/ch3-*`, `audits/ch4-*`, `briefs/ch3-*`,
`briefs/ch4-*`.

**What changed since Chapter 2.** Much of this plan's raw material already exists on
`main`, written by Hydroxyi (commit `f70c57c2`, 2026-10-06, sorry-free) — notably a time
hierarchy theorem, `P ⊊ EXP`, `SPACE`/`LOGSPACE`, implicitly logspace functions,
`LOGSPACE ⊆ P`, and a logspace register-machine compiler. The plan therefore starts with
a *reception* phase (§4, P0) that brings that surface under the campaign's audit, and
builds Chapter 4 on Hydroxyi's program layers rather than on hand-built machines.

## 1. Scope

Sources: [AB09] ch. 3, pp. 68-77; ch. 4, pp. 78-94. "Exists" means proved on `main`
today; tiers are **core** (this campaign), **core-late** (this campaign, last, and the
first candidates to descope), **deferred** (backlog).

## 2. Foundation decisions (proposed; each is seeded to the relevant audit)

### 2.1 Thm 3.1 is received at `f²` strength, then strengthened to book form

Hydroxyi's theorem consumes the linear-time `Turing.universal` over one-work-tape codes,
so converting an arbitrary machine to that normal form costs a square. The book's
`f log f` needs the Hennie-Stearns `O(T log T)` simulation ([AB09] §1.7), which the
Chapter-1 plan deferred as phase 5. The received form still yields `P ⊊ EXP`, but **not**
the book's illustrative `DTIME(n) ⊊ DTIME(n^1.5)`, since `n²` exceeds `n^1.5`.

**Decision (user, 2026-10-08, CH34-Q3): strengthen.** Before the chapter-3/4 fill
epochs, the campaign builds (a) the Hennie-Stearns `k`-work-tapes-to-2 conversion at
`C·T log T` ([AB09] §1.7: parallel tracks, buffer zones of size `2^i`, amortized
shifts), and (b) a universal machine over *two-work-tape* codes at linear overhead.
Hydroxyi's diagonal argument then re-derives Thm 3.1 at `f log f`, and Theorem 1.9
reaches book strength, closing chapter 1's deferred phase 5. Until that lands, the
received form is documented as delivered strength, never as Thm 3.1 verbatim. Both
constructions are consumers of the machine-routine layer (§4a).

### 2.2 Oracle classes

- **A finite bundle `FinOracleTM`** carrying `Fintype`/`DecidableEq` for states, with
  `WellFormed` as a field. This is the Chapter-1 phase-1 obligation: "oracle complexity
  classes will introduce a finite oracle-machine bundle".
- **An oracle NDTM** combining the binary-choice NDTM with the oracle step. Def 3.4 says
  only that nondeterministic oracle machines are "defined similarly".
- **`Pᴼ` and `NPᴼ` mirror `P` and `NTIME`** literally: the same `c · T n` and
  `n^c + 1` normal forms, with all-branch halting for `NPᴼ`.
- **Query tape:** the existing persistent convention (no auto-erase). The Chapter-1
  obligation to prove polynomial equivalence with the auto-erased convention is scheduled
  only if some consumer imports an invariance; none in this plan does.
- **One general lemma does most of the light work:** `L ≤ₚ O ⇒ L ∈ Pᴼ`. It writes `f(x)`
  on the query tape, queries, and copies the answer. Ex 3.6(1), the `A` half of Thm 3.7,
  and `NP ⊆ P^SAT` all follow from it.

### 2.3 Baker-Gill-Solovay

- **The `B` half follows the book.** `U_B ∈ NP^B` is a small oracle-NDTM construction.
  `U_B ∉ P^B` is the stage construction. It is mathematics, not machine-building: runs
  that agree on every queried string agree (by lockstep); a run of `t` steps queries at
  most `t` strings, each of length at most `t` (`queryString_length_le` exists); and
  `FinOracleTM`s can be enumerated with every machine recurring infinitely often, through
  `Fintype.equivFin` plus state relabelling, with no universal oracle machine needed.
- **The `A` half takes the book's route: `A = EXPCOM`** (user decision 2026-10-08,
  CH34-Q4 — preferred as the more natural oracle, with `P^EXPCOM = NP^EXPCOM = EXP` the
  memorable byproduct), via the chain `EXP ⊆ P^EXPCOM ⊆ NP^EXPCOM ⊆ EXP` (Ex 3.6(3)).
  - `EXP ⊆ P^EXPCOM`: the reduction `x ↦ ⟨M_L, x, 1^(n+1)^c⟩` (constant prefix, copy,
    unary padding emitter — chapter-2 padding-cluster precedents), then one query
    through the §2.2 lemma.
  - `NP^EXPCOM ⊆ EXP` is **a fill summit**: for each language, a deterministic
    exponential-time machine that enumerates all choice words of the fixed oracle NDTM
    (the `NP_subset_EXP` enumerator pattern), simulates it step by step under each word
    (2B-style invariant), and answers each query `⟨M', x', 1^(n')⟩` by parsing it
    (CodeParser) and running the timed universal machine for `2^(n')` steps (the
    `timed_universal` bridge), under a `2^O(p(n))` ledger. Continuation budget certain.
  - The machine-light alternative — [BGS75, Thm 1]'s own self-referential
    `A = K(A) = {⟨i, x, 0ⁿ⟩ : NPᵢᴬ accepts x in < n steps}`, well-founded because a
    `< n`-step run queries only shorter strings — is **recorded as the fallback**: if
    the summit stalls, switching requires only the oracle-locality lemma (needed for
    the `B` half anyway) plus a maintainer sign-off, and the blueprint would cite
    [BGS75, Thm 1] with a deviation note.

### 2.4 Space

- **Reuse `SPACE` and `LOGSPACE` unchanged**: deterministic, halting, counting visited
  work cells summed over the work tapes, with input and output excluded. [AB09] is itself
  inconsistent here: Def 4.1 counts *visited* cells for `SPACE` but *non-blank* cells for
  `NSPACE`. The vendored `Deterministic.lean` docstring and `SpaceComplexity/Basic.lean`
  currently disagree about what [AB09] says. P0 fixes the documentation, and the visited
  measure is used for both classes.
- **`NSPACE` (CH34-Q7, provisional answer: all branches halt).** It needs a new NDTM space
  measure along `runWith`, adapting the `visitedByTapeHead` pattern to choice words.
  Provisionally, `N` decides `L` in space `s` if on every input there is some `T` with
  `HaltsWithin x T`, every choice word stays within `s(|x|)` cells, and `x ∈ L` iff some
  choice word accepts. All-branch halting matches `NTIME`, lax-434930's convention and
  Remark 4.3's alternative, and it makes the configuration-count arguments direct.
- **Space-constructibility mirrors `TimeConstructible`.** A machine writes
  `(S |x|).bits` within space `c · (S |x|)`, and the definition carries
  `∀ n, logSpace n ≤ S n`, which is [AB09]'s standing `S(n) > log n` (p. 79).
  Theorems needing only weaker hypotheses say so. This is seeded to the P4.1 audit.
- **The classes:** `PSPACE := ⋃ c, SPACE (n^c + 1)`, and likewise `NPSPACE`;
  `NL := NSPACE logSpace`; `coNL` in complement form, like `coNP`.
- **Positive bounds everywhere (P0 round 1, finding 1).** Unnormalized `SPACE s`
  collapses to the zero-work-tape class as soon as `s` has one zero (every machine has
  `k ≤ spaceUsed`), so **every asymptotic chapter statement uses an everywhere-positive
  bound** (`n + 1`, `n^c + 1`, `logSpace`) — never a literal `fun n => n`. The collapse
  and the harmless-normalization identities are stated as the sanity layer
  `SpaceComplexity/ZeroSpace.lean` (S1-S4; elaborated, proofs deferred to fill,
  each certified true as stated by the P0 round-2 audit); the same applies verbatim to
  `NSPACE` (branch space also dominates the tape count).
- **`≤ₗ` reuses `ImplicitlyLogspaceComputable`** (Def 4.16, with its documented
  divergences: `C(|x|+1)^c` length bound and 0-based index).

### 2.5 Machine substrate for Chapter 4: program layers, not hand-built machines

Chapter 2's lesson, and the backlog's machine-routine-layer entry, is that hand-built
machines dominate the cost. For space the relevant layers already exist on `main`:

- **`LogProg.ARM`** (`SpaceComplexity/Machines/`) is an abstract register machine with
  `O(log n)`-bit registers and calls to `LOGSPACE` deciders. It compiles to `FinTM` with a
  space theorem (`compile_space`, `arm_decides`, `arm_decides_poly`). It is
  **deterministic only**.
- **`CounterProg`** (`TuringMachine/CounterProg{,Run}.lean`) has unary registers and
  forward input reading. It compiles with a time bound (`t` steps become at most
  `t(2t+3)`), so it suits the `2^O(S)`-time searches, where register values of size
  `2^O(S)` are affordable. Its input is one-way (`rd` only advances), but a configuration
  successor must read the input at the simulated head. Those searches therefore need
  either ARM-style indexed input access or a rewind instruction.

Proposed extensions, each a P4.x infrastructure statement with its own audit:

1. **A nondeterministic ARM**: a `choose` instruction compiling to `FinNDTM`, with the
   space theorem carried over. This serves `PATH ∈ NL`, Immerman-Szelepcsényi and
   Cor 4.21.
2. **A polynomial-width ARM variant** with registers of `poly(n)` bits, for the
   `PSPACE`-level algorithms: `TQBF ∈ PSPACE`, `NP ⊆ PSPACE`, Savitch at polynomial
   level. It is either a generalization of `compile_space` or a sibling.
3. **A configuration codec**, shared by Thm 4.2(iii), Savitch, Thm 4.18, Cor 4.21 and
   `TQBF` hardness. It encodes the configurations of a fixed machine, with work tapes
   windowed to `s` cells and the input head as a separate register, as `O(s)`-bit
   register contents, and provides a successor/adjacency test as a program. The counting
   half adapts cslib's new upstream `MultiTape/ConfigBound.lean` design (Sept 2026,
   `Storage`/`Cfg.core`) and extends Hydroxyi's deterministic `ConfigCount` to NDTMs.
   It must be cited and adapted, not vendored: cslib targets a newer Lean with the
   module system.

This requires Hydroxyi's agreement, since these are their modules (CH34-Q2).

### 2.6 Formulas and graphs

- **The QBF matrix (CH34-Q5).** Def 4.10 allows a general unquantified matrix; we have
  only `Std.Sat.CNF ℕ` and the DNF dual. Provisional choice: prenex QBF with a **CNF
  matrix**, reusing the CNF carrier, serialization and parser. [AB09] notes on p. 83 that
  the CNF restriction is harmless via auxiliary variables, so `TQBF` hardness pays a
  Tseitin step. A general-formula carrier is the alternative, which Chapter 5 and a
  general `TAUTOLOGY` would also want.
- **`PATH` needs the campaign's first graph encoding**: an adjacency-matrix
  serialization plus `s`, `t` in binary via `pairEncode`, with a parser and the
  `codeFallback`-style totalization. It stays in-house in `Complexity/`, with
  `GraphTheory.Digraph.Reachable` as the semantic target.

### 2.7 Universal machines

- **Thm 4.8 needs a space-efficient universal machine (Ex 4.1).** The existing `universal`
  and `timed_universal` are time-only, and their code scheme covers only the
  one-work-tape binary normal form. So either the Chapter-1 robustness conversions
  (`one_work_tape`, alphabet reduction) gain space theorems, or a fresh space-universal
  machine takes multi-tape codes. This is the largest single risk in Chapter 4 (§6).
- **Thm 3.2 needs NDTM codes and a clocked universal NDTM (Ex 2.6), at linear
  overhead** (user decision 2026-10-08, CH34-Q8). Polynomial overhead would deliver only
  `f(n+1)^c = o(g(n))`; linear overhead gives the book's `f(n+1) = o(g(n))`. The
  guess-then-verify technique (guess the whole tableau of choice/configuration data,
  then check each tape's consistency in one pass — Book-Greibach style) achieves a
  code-dependent constant factor, which is the strongest form possible: a simulation of
  `t` steps cannot run faster than the `t` steps it reproduces, and the code-dependent
  constant is necessary for the same reason as chapter 1's Argument E. Another
  routine-layer consumer.

## 3. Architecture and module layout

New campaign directories (namespace `Complexity`, facades per policy §1):

| Directory | Contents |
|---|---|
| `TuringMachine/OracleFinite.lean`, `TuringMachine/OracleNondeterministic.lean` | `FinOracleTM`, oracle NDTM, runs, and lockstep embeddings of plain machines |
| `ClassOracle/` | `Pᴼ`, `NPᴼ`, the `≤ₚ ⇒ Pᴼ` lemma, Ex 3.6, oracle-machine enumeration, `Relativization.lean` (Thm 3.7) |
| `Diagonalization/` | `NTimeHierarchy.lean` (Thm 3.2), `Ladner.lean` (Thm 3.3), `NotTimeConstructible.lean` (Ex 3.5) |
| `TuringMachine/NondeterministicSpace.lean`, `TuringMachine/NDCodes.lean` | NDTM space measure; NDTM codes and the universal NDTM |
| `SpaceComplexity/` (extending Hydroxyi's tree, subject to CH34-Q2) | `NSPACE.lean`, `Classes.lean` (`PSPACE`/`NPSPACE`/`NL`/`coNL`), `Constructible.lean`, `Inclusions.lean` (Thm 4.2), `ConfigGraph.lean`, `Savitch.lean`, `Hierarchy.lean`, `Logspace/{Reductions,Path,ImmermanSzelepcsenyi}.lean` |
| `Formulas/QBF.lean`, `Formulas/QBFEncoding.lean`; `ClassPSPACE/TQBF.lean` | the QBF carrier and serialization; Thm 4.13 |

Chapter-1/2 files stay frozen at their audited surface. Additions to Hydroxyi's trees
follow whatever ownership rule CH34-Q2 sets.

## 4. Phasing

Statement phases, each gated by an audit before the next one lands. The order reflects
infrastructure dependencies and retires risk early: the light half of Chapter 3, then
Chapter 4, then Chapter 3's two heavy diagonalizations.

| Phase | Contents | New sorried statements (est.) |
|---|---|---|
| **P0 — Reception** | Statements-only audit of the existing surface the campaign will build on: `time_hierarchy`, `P_ssubset_EXP`, `SPACE`, `LOGSPACE`, `ImplicitlyLogspaceComputable`, `LOGSPACE_subset_P`, `ComputesInTime.of_spaceUsed_le`, and the `arm_decides` and `compile_space` contracts. Docstring fixes (the §2.4 inconsistency; the stale "spec phase, sorried" notes in `Build/*`). Drift baseline recorded. No new sorries. | 0 |
| **P3.1 — Oracle classes** | `FinOracleTM`, the oracle NDTM, `Pᴼ`, `NPᴼ`; `P ⊆ Pᴼ`, `NPᴼ` contains `Pᴼ`; the `≤ₚ ⇒ Pᴼ` lemma; Ex 3.6(1)(2); `NP ⊆ P^SAT` as a sanity theorem | ~10 |
| **P3.2 — Relativization** | Oracle-machine enumeration; `U_B ∈ NP^B`; the stage construction; the EXPCOM cluster (`EXPCOM`, `EXP ⊆ P^EXPCOM`, `NP^EXPCOM ⊆ EXP`, `P^EXPCOM = NP^EXPCOM = EXP` — Ex 3.6(3)); Thm 3.7; Ex 3.5 | ~11 |
| **P4.1 — Space classes** | NDTM space measure, `NSPACE`, space-constructibility, the classes; Thm 4.2(i)(ii); `L ⊆ NL`; `3SAT ∈ PSPACE`, `NP ⊆ PSPACE`; `EVEN`, `MULT ∈ L`; the nondeterministic and polynomial-width ARM interfaces | ~14 |
| **P4.2 — Configuration graphs** | The configuration codec; Claim 4.4(1) for NDTMs; Thm 4.2(iii); Savitch; `PSPACE = NPSPACE`; `NL ⊆ P`; Ex 4.3 | ~10 |
| **P4.3 — `PSPACE`-completeness and space hierarchy** | Def 4.9; the QBF carrier, `TQBF`, Claim 4.4(2), Thm 4.13 (both halves); the space-universal machine (Ex 4.1); Thm 4.8; `L ⊊ PSPACE`; Ex 3.2; Ex 4.10 | ~12 |
| **P4.4 — Logspace and `NL`** | `≤ₗ`, `NL`-completeness, Lemma 4.17; the graph encoding, `PATH ∈ NL`, Thm 4.18; Thm 4.20; Cor 4.21 | ~10 |
| **P3.3 — Nondeterministic hierarchy** | NDTM codes, the clocked universal NDTM (Ex 2.6), Thm 3.2 at delivered strength | ~6 |
| **P3.4 — Ladner** | `SAT_H`; Ex 3.6(a) (`H` in polynomial time); the Claim; Ex 3.6(b); Thm 3.3 | ~6 |

That is roughly 78 new audited statements, against Chapter 2's 59.

### 4a. Pre-campaign infrastructure (user decisions 2026-10-08)

The machine-routine layer and its two headline consumers run **in parallel with the
statement phases**, and gate only the fill epochs:

1. **The routine layer** (`machine-library-design.md` §12, to be written): bank
   embedding, seam composition, catalog promotion — **scoped to amply support the
   chapter-1/2 retrofit**, not just the new consumers. Its catalog therefore covers the
   privately re-derived bank / relocation / dispatch / frame families of `Build/*`,
   `Universal*`, and `CookLevin/Hardness.lean` (the backlog retrofit entry's list), and
   **every routine carries a space cost alongside its time cost** from the start, so
   chapter 4 and the space statements (P4.x) can consume it without a second pass. The
   P0/P4.1 space statements are drafted while the layer is being designed, precisely so
   they can inform what else the layer needs (CH34-Q1).
2. **Hennie-Stearns + the two-work-tape universal machine** (§2.1): the layer's first
   new consumers, giving Thms 1.9 and 3.1 at book strength. The two-tape universal is a
   rewrite of `Universal.lean`, making it the natural retrofit pilot. Candidate bonus,
   to be checked at design time: carrying space bounds through it may also yield the
   space-efficient universal machine that Thm 4.8 needs (Ex 4.1).
3. **The chapter-1/2 retrofit** itself is *not* a gate for chapters 3-4: public surfaces
   are frozen, so retrofit batches run alongside the chapter-3/4 phases under the
   standard sweep + traversal + audit protocol.

**Fill campaign.** Fill work starts after the gates close, in epochs ordered by risk as
before. Two infrastructure prerequisites gate the machine-heavy epochs:

- the machine-routine layer as scoped above;
- the ARM extensions of §2.5.

**Integration with `main`.** Proposed: one PR per closed chapter (Chapter 3's light half
may go earlier), not one campaign-sized PR like #3. Main's CI runs only on pushes to
`main`, so each PR carries the local evidence: sweep, axiom prints, and the blueprint web
build.

### 4b. Post-statement-program roadmap (recorded 2026-10-09; user-directed)

Recorded at the close of the statement program — every statement gate shut
(P0, P3.1-P3.3, P4.1-P4.4, §12; decision log) — with roughly 150
audited-true sorried statements frozen and the carried obligations
collected in the nine `audits/*-resolutions.md` files. The remaining
stages, in order:

1. **Fill prerequisites** (gate the machine-heavy epochs, per §4a):
   - the **§12 routine-layer fill** (56 statements; partition in §4c) —
     the engine nearly every chapter-3/4 sketch names;
   - the **ARM extensions** (§2.5: nondeterministic and polynomial-width
     program layers; first customers the `PATH` walk and the counting
     verifier) — the open **colleague-sync item** on Hydroxyi's `LogProg`
     tree;
   - **Hennie-Stearns + the two-work-tape universal** (§2.1, CH34-Q3):
     Thms 1.9/3.1 to book strength; the retrofit pilot; candidate bonus:
     space bounds through it may yield Ex 4.1's space-efficient universal
     for the Thm 4.8 fill.
2. **The fill epochs** (`workflow.md` §4): sequential, risk-ordered,
   parallel disjoint-ownership batches from `briefs/`, epoch-boundary
   audits. Summit order per §6: the space-universal + Thm 4.8; the
   `NP^EXPCOM ⊆ EXP` simulator; the `TQBF` `ψᵢ` emitter; the
   linear-overhead universal NDTM; Thm 4.2(iii) + Savitch; Immerman-
   Szelepcsényi; Lemma 4.17. (Ladner's `H` rides with P3.4.)
3. **P3.4 (Ladner)** — on hold (user, 2026-10-09); drafts from the
   backlog §2 entry whenever called, independent of the fills.
4. **The chapter-1/2 retrofit** — not a gate; batches alongside the
   epochs. Queued housekeeping with it: the per-theme `Catalog` split
   (12.2c), the P3.1 natural-home promotions (unblocked), the additive
   sanity layers (`NSPACE` twins, `mem_NL_of_logspaceReducible`,
   `Cfg.InWindow` promotion).
5. **Closure** (`workflow.md` §5): zero-sorry sweep, campaign-wide drift
   attestation, final audit pack, blueprint increment (late-bound).
6. **Integration with `main`**: one PR per closed chapter (chapter 3's
   light half may go early), each carrying sweep, axiom prints, and the
   blueprint build, since main's CI runs only on `main`.

### 4c. Routine-layer fill: epoch/batch partition (recorded 2026-10-09)

The §12 surface is three files, 56 audited-true statements (Embed 13,
Seam 11, Catalog 32). Exclusive file ownership (workflow §4, ground
rule 1) shapes the partition; the proof plans inherited from the audit
loop (`audits/routine-infra-{findings,r2-findings,r3-findings}.md`,
summarized in `audits/routine-infra-resolutions.md`) make this the
best-documented fill surface of the campaign.

**Epoch F1 — kernels and routines (3 parallel batches, 37 targets).**

| Batch | Owns | Targets | Contents and risk notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1A | `Build/Embed.lean` | 13 | The `embedSlot` equations and one-step commutation core first, then the four flavor families: silent lockstep/frame/visited/cap (5), emit lockstep/frame/visited (4), the returning through-halt contracts and visited equalities (4). The round-3 report's five-step induction (component check, `Option.elim` successor equations, last-step case) is the mandated proof plan for the returning pair; the `hc ↔ 0 < T` equivalence uses both first-halt hypotheses |
| F1B | `Build/Seam.lean` | 11 | The **general-configuration trio first** (`_ofCfg` run / first-return / visited — the round-2/3 reports verify the lockstep decomposition and the `(Cfg.ofWords q w).mapState f = Cfg.ofWords (f q) w` identity), then the four canonical statements **as instances**, the two additive and one max space corollaries by projection, and the release pair (fresh-step equation + `Sum.inr` lockstep) |
| F1C | `Build/Catalog.lean` | 13 | Part 1: the five routines' 11 run/space contracts — the round-1 report's exact movement table (forward `L`/`d`/`p`, one turn, return, one entry; visited exactly `[-1, ·]`) is the mandated ledger, including equal-word compare, aliased indices, and the `2p + 2` increment count — plus W1 (`capture_visitedByTapeHead`, prefix-by-prefix over `capture_run`) and W2 (`redirectTM_spaceUsedByTape`, trajectory agreement through and past the halt) |

No F1 batch consumes another's file or fills; Part-1 routines are
self-contained transition inductions. Epoch-boundary audit after F1.

**Epoch F2 — the space annotations (1 batch, 19 targets, Catalog-owned).**

| Batch | Owns | Targets | Contents and risk notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| F2A | `Build/Catalog.lean` | 19 | The Part-2 rows, risk-ordered: (i) same-witness constant rows (`id`, `const`, `prepend`, `pairEncodeFixed`, `pairValid`, `pairDup`, `incFixed`); (ii) same-witness linear rows (`pairFst`, `pairSnd`, `pairConcat`); (iii) the case-split rows (`polyUnary`; `polyBits` with the **mandatory `C = 0` / `e = 0` constant-witness splits**, round-1 R5); (iv) `lengthBits` (the direct variable-width-counter construction — the imported sharp witness is explicitly not relied on), `pairLenCheck`, `stripLast` (linear banks; quadratic time is slack), `splitSolve`; (v) `cond` (W3: disjoint decider/branch banks) and `exists_loopTM_spaceUsed` (L: the round-1 answer-5 ledger — interval-union argument, fuel width `\|bits (R n)\|`, no per-round accumulation); (vi) **`pairMapSnd` last — the epoch summit and the only new machine of the fill**: the commissioned forwarding controller (validate/buffer, emit prefix, forward payload output; coefficient 1 on `Sg`; the round-2 R4 ledger), with the captured-payload witness disclaimed. Continuation brief anticipated |

F2 follows F1 so its constructions may consume proved F1 seams, though
none is required to. Epoch-boundary audit after F2 closes the §12 fill;
the S1-S12 sanity statements of the round-1 report are offered to both
epochs as optional permanent lemmas, landing wherever their batch owns.

**Ground rules** as `workflow.md` §4 (exclusive ownership, statement
freeze with escalation on unprovable-as-stated, per-batch sweeps over the
owned file, zip delivery with freeze verification, `git am -3`
integration). Every brief embeds its inherited audit material verbatim:
the movement tables (F1C), the through-halt induction (F1A), the general-
seam decomposition (F1B), and the R4/R5/answer-5 ledgers (F2A).

## 5. Prior art to consult (design only; cite, never transcribe)

- **Édouard Bonnet's Lax Archive entries** (Lean 4.33, Mathlib `db584cd6`). They use a
  different machine model (stack machines, one work tape), so none of their code ports.
  - lax-434930 `classical-complexity` (commit `0c084031…`): `L ⊆ NL ⊆ P ⊆ NP ⊆ PSPACE =
    NPSPACE ⊆ EXPTIME`. Its space model counts every visited work cell, requires every
    branch to halt, and uses `c · log₂(n+2)`. It embeds the lax-307052 Savitch proof.
  - lax-362205 Immerman-Szelepcsényi (`EdouardBonnet/immerman-szelepcsenyi` @
    `e0ffe91e`): inductive counting on finite configuration graphs.
  - lax-783278 Arc Kayles: a machine-to-game `PSPACE`-hardness that bears on the shape of
    the `TQBF` hardness proof.
  - Licences: lax-434930 states Apache-2.0 for its incorporated helpers; the others' pages
    state none. Check each before any design adaptation, under the 2026-10-06 citation
    discipline.
- **cslib upstream** (`leanprover/cslib` `main`): `MultiTape/ConfigBound.lean` and
  `TapeLemmas.lean` (space-bounded configuration counting, `exists_spaceUsedByTape_max`).
  We already diverge from cslib's relational `MultiTapeNTM` (Chapter-2 decision log).
- **Szymon Toruńczyk, lax-218471**: compositional polynomial-time computation with
  black-box subroutines. It bears on the §2.2 `≤ₚ ⇒ Pᴼ` lemma and Ex 3.6(2).

## 6. Risks and honest effort assessment

- **Chapter 4 is the larger half**, and almost all of it is machine work with *space*
  ledgers. Every existing campaign construction (Chapters 1-2, `Build/*`) is time-only,
  and `machine-library-design.md` lists "no space bounds" among its non-goals. Building
  Chapter 4 on hand-built machines would repeat Chapter 2's cost profile several times
  over. The §2.5 program layers are the mitigation, and the plan depends on them.
- **The summits**, in rough order of size:
  1. the space-universal machine plus Thm 4.8 (or space theorems for the Chapter-1
     conversions);
  2. the `NP^EXPCOM ⊆ EXP` simulator (§2.3 — choice-word enumeration, per-step oracle
     NDTM simulation, and timed-universal query answering compounded in one machine);
  3. `TQBF` hardness (a polynomial-time emitter of the `ψᵢ` formula, comparable to the
     Cook-Levin emitter);
  4. Ladner's `H` in polynomial time;
  5. the universal NDTM at linear overhead (guess-then-verify, §2.7);
  6. Thm 4.2(iii) and Savitch over the configuration codec;
  7. Immerman-Szelepcsényi;
  8. Lemma 4.17.
- **Delivered-strength honesty**: Thms 3.1 and 3.2 land weaker than the book unless
  Hennie-Stearns is built. Every docstring must say so; this was the round-1 lesson of
  every prior audit.
- **Coordination**: Chapter 4 extends a colleague's live tree, and the plan needs their
  agreement before P4.1.
- **Estimated scale**: roughly 75 statements over eight statement phases plus P0. The
  total is larger than Chapter 2; Chapter 3 alone is comparable to Chapter 1.

## 7. Open design questions (human review required)

Answered 2026-10-08 by the maintainer except where marked open; the register below is
the record, and `backlog.md` §1 gets only the open ones.

1. **CH34-Q1 — sequencing against the machine-routine layer.** **Answered: yes to
   both.** Statement phases run in parallel with the §12 design; the space statements
   are drafted early to inform the layer's scope; the catalog records space costs
   alongside time. Addendum (same date): the layer is scoped to **amply support the
   chapter-1/2 retrofit** as well (§4a).
2. **CH34-Q2 — alignment with Hydroxyi.** **Answered: extend in place, co-owned.**
3. **CH34-Q3 — Thm 3.1 strength.** **Answered: strengthen** — Hennie-Stearns + the
   two-work-tape universal before the fill epochs (§2.1, §4a).
4. **CH34-Q4 — the `A` half of Thm 3.7.** **Answered (2026-10-08): the book's
   `EXPCOM` route** — more natural, and `P^EXPCOM = NP^EXPCOM = EXP` is the memorable
   identity; Ex 3.6(3) is core and `NP^EXPCOM ⊆ EXP` joins the summit list. Research
   note retained: the machine-light self-referential oracle is [BGS75, Thm 1]'s own
   proof (verified against the scanned original, pp. 433-434) and stays recorded as
   the fallback (§2.3). [BGS75] detail for the P3.1 audit: the polynomial clock must
   hold under *every* oracle, which constrains how `Pᴼ`/`NPᴼ` quantify the time bound.
5. **CH34-Q5 — QBF matrix.** **Answered: CNF.**
6. **CH34-Q6 — tiers.** **Answered: Thm 3.2 mandatory; Thm 3.3 (Ladner) core-late.**
7. **CH34-Q7 — `NSPACE` halting convention.** **Answered: all branches halt.**
8. **CH34-Q8 — universal-NDTM overhead.** **Answered (2026-10-08): linear overhead**,
   the strongest form possible (§2.7) — Thm 3.2 lands at the book's
   `f(n+1) = o(g(n))`.

## 8. Decision log

| Decision | Status |
|---|---|
| Chapters 3-4 run as one campaign on `complexity/arora-barak-ch3-4` (from `main` @ `99b187fc`), same methodology as Chapters 1-2; artifacts `ch3-*`/`ch4-*` | Proposed |
| Existing sorry-free Chapter-3/4 material on `main` (Hydroxyi, `f70c57c2`) is received and audited (P0), never duplicated | Proposed |
| Prior-art survey (2026-10-08): repository inventory (§1 tables); Bonnet lax-434930/362205/783278, cslib `ConfigBound`, Toruńczyk lax-218471 (§5) | Recorded |
| Chapter 4 machine work goes through program layers (`LogProg.ARM`, `CounterProg`, proposed extensions §2.5) | Proposed |
| §2 foundation choices and §7 provisional answers | **Answered 2026-10-08** (user): Q1 yes to both, Q2 extend in place co-owned, Q3 strengthen, Q5 CNF, Q6 Thm 3.2 mandatory / Ladner core-late, Q7 all branches halt. Q4 and Q8 open |
| Routine layer set up in parallel with the statement phases, scoped to **amply support the ch-1/2 retrofit** (full bank/relocation/dispatch/frame catalog), with space costs throughout; Hennie-Stearns + two-tape universal as first consumers; retrofit itself not a gate (§4a) | Decided (user, 2026-10-08) |
| §12 open decision 12.1 answered (user, 2026-10-08): R2 seam-composition space accounting takes the **sharper per-tape form** (max on disjointly-owned tapes) — sharpest available, for downstream applications | Decided |
| **P3.1 and P4.1 statement skeletons landed** (2026-10-08): `TuringMachine/{OracleFinite,OracleNondeterministic,NondeterministicSpace}.lean`, `ClassOracle/{Classes,SATOracle}.lean` + facade, `SpaceComplexity/{NSPACE,SpaceClasses,Constructible,Inclusions,Examples}.lean`; 24 sorried statements (10 oracle + 14 space), each with a policy-grade sketch; skeleton-time proofs: the `toFinOracleTM` bridge and the oracle `runWith` algebra (mirrors of proved infrastructure, flagged for the audits). All modules elaborate fresh (zero errors); style lint 0 FAIL; `Ex 4.7`'s `MULT` deferred to P4.4 (encoding conventions), the ARM extension interfaces deferred to the §12 gate + colleague sync. Audit packs for P3.1/P4.1 follow once P0's round returns | Recorded |
| **§12 statement skeleton landed** (2026-10-08, sub-agent drafted, maintainer-reviewed line by line): `Build/Embed.lean` (R1, two transformers over a shared core per 12.4, 9 sorried), `Build/Seam.lean` (R2, dispatch constant exactly 1, per-tape visited-set containment headline per 12.1, 6 sorried), `Build/Catalog.lean` (R3, five seam routines defined + W1-W3/L and P1-P15 space rows, 32 sorried; `Primitives.lean` byte-identical per 12.2a). Review: machine semantics traced phase by phase; restated time clauses spot-checked **verbatim** against `computesFunInTime_id`/`_prepend`/`_cond`/`exists_loopTM`; scope clarification: stream rows P16-P18 ride with the emitter-lazy scope (flagged to the gate). All modules elaborate, 0 errors; its statement-gate pack is next | Recorded |
| **P3.2 statement skeleton landed** (2026-10-08, sub-agent drafted, maintainer-reviewed line by line): `TuringMachine/OracleAgreement.lean` (7 sorried) + `Diagonalization/{EXPCOM,Relativization,NotTimeConstructible}.lean` + facade (10 sorried) — 17 statements; EXPCOM per CH34-Q4, extrinsic-clock enumeration per [BGS75], Ex 3.5 non-trivialized. Review fixes: stage-construction sketch's decided-length bound corrected to `max nᵢ (budget)` (the `i = 0` edge). Five natural-home promotions flagged for the P3.1 gate close; all cited lemma names verified to exist. P3.1 files untouched (layout decision: all of P3.2 lives in `Diagonalization/`) | Recorded |
| **Two statement-gate packs out in parallel** (2026-10-08): `audits/routine-infra-{pack,bundle}.md` (the §12 layer: 47 statements; bundle sha256 `e9216b8b…`, 14 attachments incl. the byte-identical `Build/` context) and `audits/ch3-p32-{pack,bundle}.md` (P3.2: 17 statements; bundle sha256 `dbfadcfb…`, 22 attachments incl. the unaudited P3.1 surface with the layering caveat declared, [BGS75] scanned-original link supplied). Fresh per-pack sweeps with revisions recorded at start (0 errors; 47 and 17 sorry warnings exactly); both gates close on zero blockers/majors. Disjoint audit surfaces — concurrent repairs cannot collide with each other or with the P0/R2 surface | Recorded |
| **P0 reception gate CLOSED** (round 2, 2026-10-08, `audits/ch34-p0-r2-findings.md`: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 3 minors**; loop summary `audits/ch34-p0-resolutions.md`). The repair diff was reconstructed hash-exactly by the auditor; all ten S-statements independently derived true as stated; S9 admits the tighter `t·(2B+3)` (recorded for fill, statement unchanged). The three minors swept in the closing commit and re-verified: the `Reaches.toB` reference corrected (finding 6 residual), "machine-checked" wording honestied to "elaborated, proofs deferred" (finding 11), and the two timed zero-tape witness statements added to `ZeroSpace.lean` (finding 12; now 11 sorried there). Two pack errata acknowledged in the resolutions. The received 44-module surface is adopted; the P3.1 and P4.1 statement gates are unblocked | Recorded |
| **P3.1 and P4.1 statement-gate packs out** (2026-10-08, unblocked by the P0 closure): `audits/ch3-p31-{pack,bundle}.md` (10 statements + declared skeleton-time proofs; bundle sha256 `37d2fd94…`, 19 attachments; concurrent-P3.2 cross-filing note) and `audits/ch4-p41-{pack,bundle}.md` (14 statements; bundle sha256 `58bdb768…`, 22 attachments; sits on the P0-closed surface, inherits and declares the zero-bound collapse for `NSPACE`, seeds the `NSPACE` sanity-twin question and the `evenLang` zero-tape harmonization). Fresh per-pack sweeps with revisions at start: 0 errors, exactly 10 and 14 sorry warnings. **All four early statement phases are now under concurrent external audit** on pairwise-disjoint surfaces | Recorded |
| **P4.2 statement skeleton landed** (2026-10-08, maintainer-drafted): `SpaceComplexity/ConfigGraph.lean` (the vertex = core **plus a three-valued output summary** — the P0 fitness note's acceptance gap closed by design; `CfgStep`/reachability dictionary; ND Claim 4.4(1) in acceptance form; the packaged `DecidesInSpace` iff; Thm 4.2(iii) with the `2^(c·(S n + 1))` union rendering; `NL ⊆ P`; Ex 4.3 as nontrivial-NL-hardness, with the exercise's moral in the docstring) and `SpaceComplexity/Savitch.lean` (`spaceConstructible_poly` at degree ≥ 1 — degree 0 provably fails the bundled `logSpace ≤ S`; Savitch via the iterative frame stack, a §12 R1/R2 consumer; `PSPACE = NPSPACE`). 10 sorried statements, zero errors, lint 0 FAIL. **The P4.1-frozen facade is untouched**: both modules wired through the root import only, facade wiring deferred to the P4.1 gate close. Layering: builds on P4.1 (under audit) + P0-closed surface; its gate pack follows the P3.2-over-P3.1 declared-caveat pattern, after the P4.1 round returns | Recorded |
| **P4.3 statement skeleton landed** (2026-10-08, maintainer-drafted): `Formulas/{QBF,QBFEncoding}.lean` (prenex QBF with CNF matrix per CH34-Q5; free-variables-read-false totalization; true-fallback decode matching the `SAT` polarity; the Example-4.12 `SAT` embedding), `ClassPSPACE/{TQBF,Games}.lean` + facade (Def 4.9 over `≤ₚ`; the collapse corollary; **Claim 4.4(2) existentially packaged with two declared deviations** — `O(s+n)` one-hot-input codec for locality, polynomial rather than linear CNF size, both harmless to Thm 4.13; `TQBF` + both halves of Thm 4.13, hardness = the `ψᵢ`-emitter summit; Zermelo determinacy), `SpaceComplexity/Hierarchy.lean` (the space-universal machine with the `+ logSpace` clock addend declared against Ex 4.1's literal `Ct`; Thm 4.8 at **constant-factor** hypothesis strength — no square, no log, the space story's advantage over the received `f²` time hierarchy; `L ⊊ PSPACE`; Ex 3.2 at the `n+1` normalization with the `NP` `≤ₚ`-closure named as a derived obligation). 12 sorried statements, zero errors, lint 0 FAIL. Facade wiring: new `ClassPSPACE` facade + `Formulas` facade extended (closed-campaign, not frozen); `Hierarchy` root-wired since the `SpaceComplexity` facade stays P4.1-frozen. Its gate pack follows the layered-caveat pattern once P4.1/P4.2 rounds allow | Recorded |
| **P4.4 statement skeleton landed** (2026-10-08, maintainer-drafted) — **the chapter-4 statement program is complete**: `SpaceComplexity/Logspace/{Reductions,Path,ImmermanSzelepcsenyi,Mult}.lean`, 11 sorried statements. `≤ₗ` over the received implicit-logspace layer; **general Lemma 4.17 now stated** (`ImplicitlyLogspaceComputable.comp` — the composition the P0 round recorded as undelivered), with transitivity, the `L`-downward closure, the `≤ₚ` refinement, and the `NL = L` collapse corollary; the campaign's first graph encoding (`encodePATH`, EXPCOM-pattern existential membership) with `GraphReach` **in-house** (deviation from plan §2.6's `Digraph.Reachable` target: the GraphTheory tree carries admissions outside the audited closure; bridging lemma recorded as future work); `PATH ∈ NL` and Thm 4.18 (hardness via the P4.2 vertex layer, the accepting normalization discharging the P0 unique-terminal caveat; the reduction's bit queries assembled by the received `arm_decides`); Thm 4.20 both as `PATHᶜ ∈ NL` and `NL = coNL`, with **no read-once certificate model** — the binary-choice NDTM's choice words are natively read-once, a declared simplification; Cor 4.21 over the P4.2 configuration-graph layer; `MULT ∈ L` closing Ex 4.7. The nondeterministic ARM extension gains its first two named customers (the `PATH` walk, the counting verifier). Zero errors; lint 0 FAIL; root-wired (facade stays P4.1-frozen) | Recorded |
| **P3.1 gate CLOSED** (round 1, 2026-10-08: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 2 minors / 4 notes** — `audits/ch3-p31-findings.md` verbatim, loop summary `audits/ch3-p31-resolutions.md`). Minors swept in the closing commit: the Theorem-2.6 docstring equation regains its load-bearing `+1` (auditor-refuted, maintainer-verified against `NP_eq_iUnion_NTIME`), and the Ex 3.6(2) sketch carries the explicit query ledger at degree `k·(1+max 1 e)` with the extracted-prefix-only virtual-input obligation. The fixed-oracle clock split is confirmed sound, with the timeout-wrapper reconciliation carried to the P3.2 gate. Natural-home promotions stay deferred until P3.2 closes | Recorded |
| **P4.1 gate CLOSED** (round 1, 2026-10-08: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 5 minors / 4 notes** — `audits/ch4-p41-findings.md` verbatim, loop summary `audits/ch4-p41-resolutions.md`). Minors swept: both constructibility sketches corrected at `n = 0` (bits-length identity; counter initialized at `1`), the exact-space refutation claim retracted (time's argument does not transfer), the `evenLang` route kept direct (the pack's harmonization suggestion was cycle-inducing — pack erratum acknowledged, with the inventory undercount), SAT3 at delivered polynomial strength. Carried obligations: `NSPACE` sanity twins as a future additive layer; the short-prefix argument into the invariance fill; `NP ⊆ PSPACE`'s five host obligations and its hard §12 R1/R2/R3 dependency into the fill brief. **The `SpaceComplexity` facade is unfrozen and now carries the P4.2-P4.4 modules**; the P4.2 pack is unblocked | Recorded |
| **P4.3 landing erratum repaired** (2026-10-08): the `Formulas.lean` facade extension of 572304e5 appended its two QBF imports **after** the module docstring — invalid Lean. The landing sweep did not include the facade module, so the error went undetected, and the facade's sole dependent (the root `TCSlib.lean`) elaborated against the stale pre-P4.3 olean. Repaired in place (imports moved into the header block, `## Contents` rows added for `QBF`/`QBFEncoding`); the facade re-elaborates fresh, 0 errors (the root itself stays outside the campaign sweep surface — it imports non-campaign trees with no scratch oleans — so its exposure was import-order only). Sweep-hygiene consequence adopted: every gate sweep lists the touched facades explicitly | Recorded |
| **Three statement-gate packs out in parallel** (2026-10-08): `audits/ch4-p42-{pack,bundle}.md` (P4.2: 10 statements; bundle sha256 `5139d5ae…`, 24 attachments), `audits/ch4-p43-{pack,bundle}.md` (P4.3: 12 statements; bundle sha256 `5a52f398…`, 30 attachments, P4.2-unaudited layering caveat declared), `audits/ch4-p44-{pack,bundle}.md` (P4.4: 11 statements; bundle sha256 `899d3c43…`, 24 attachments, same caveat). All three audited at `200f4693`; fresh per-pack sweeps with revisions recorded at start (0 errors; 10/12/11 sorry warnings exactly); style lint re-scoped after assembly review caught the single-directory linter CLI (SpaceComplexity 42 + Formulas 5 + ClassPSPACE 2 files, 0 FAIL / 0 WARN). Review repairs applied before shipping (the P3.2 pattern, each disclosed in its pack): the QBF sketch's `eval_congr_of_lt_numVars` namespace (`0a1982a0`); `PSPACE_eq_NPSPACE`'s degree-0 routing off bare `NSPACE.mono` (fails pointwise at `n = 0`) and the splice-padding clause in `acceptsWithin_of_spaceUsedWith_le` (`200f4693`). Attachment manifests extended per the P4.1 erratum lesson (TEMPLATE, closed resolutions, `NTIME.lean`; P0 findings where quoted). Disjoint audit surfaces; **five rounds now live** (§12, P3.2, P4.2, P4.3, P4.4) — the chapter-3/4 statement program has every drafted phase under external audit | Recorded |
| **P3.3 statement skeleton landed** (2026-10-08, maintainer-drafted): `TuringMachine/NDCodes.lean` (the two-work-tape coded normal form `CodeNDTM` — two tapes because the [BGW70]-style guess-then-verify reduction is linear into two, not one — with `actionBits₂` serialization mirroring `CodeTM.serialize` record for record, the `NDMachineCode`/`EffectiveNDMachineCode` scheme laws, the skeleton-time `decode_encode` mirror, and the sorried scheme existence; 1 sorried) and `Diagonalization/NTimeHierarchy.lean` (the clocked universal NDTM at **linear overhead** per CH34-Q8 — iff-packaged with an unconditional fused clock, the book's timeout-accept polarity declared absorbed; the exponential deterministic acceptance evaluator; the linear coded-normal-form transfer with deliberately unbounded backward direction + the truncation note; **Thm 3.2 at book strength** with the extra `f n` domination addend declared (covers the inclusion half without monotonicity); the positive-bound form; the showcase `NTIME(n+1) ⊊ NTIME((n+1)²)` with the squared-overhead impossibility note; 6 sorried). 7 sorried total, 0 errors, lint 0 FAIL (Diagonalization 0 WARN; TuringMachine only the pre-existing size WARNs). **Root-wired**: the `Diagonalization.lean` facade is frozen under the live P3.2 gate and `TuringMachine.lean` is untouched — facade wiring at the respective closes (the P4.2 precedent). Gate pack after the relevant rounds return | Recorded |
| **P3.4 (Ladner) moved to backlog** (user, 2026-10-08): per CH34-Q6 core-late — `backlog.md` §2 entry with scope (`SAT_H`, Ex 3.6(a)/(b), the Claim, Thm 3.3, ~6 statements) and the trigger (draft when the live rounds settle; independent of P3.3's code layer). With P3.3 drafted, **every core phase of the chapter-3/4 statement program is drafted**; P3.4 is the sole remaining statement phase | Recorded |
| **P4.2 gate CLOSED** (round 1, 2026-10-08: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 5 minors / 3 notes** — `audits/ch4-p42-findings.md` verbatim, loop summary `audits/ch4-p42-resolutions.md`). Minors swept: the splice sketch's sibling-halting assertion dropped (the statement has no such hypothesis — the accepting branch alone pads, auditor counterexample confirmed), Exercise 4.3's printed "complete" recorded as a **textbook erratum** (hardness only; completeness needs `L ∈ NL`), the received count cited as `Turing.FinTM.configBound`, `LOGSPACE_subset_P` described as count-arithmetic precedent rather than "the same search", the `+ 1` described as normalization (the `c = 0` exponent is `0`). Carried: the carrier-bridge obligations (quotient lifting, outside-window rejection, reflexive base), the resource ledgers (constructor time through the received count theorem, fixed-interval frame reuse, exact `(n^c+1).bits` output), and the pack's question-3 sibling erratum acknowledged | Recorded |
| **P4.4 gate CLOSED** (round 1, 2026-10-08: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 2 minors / 5 notes** — `audits/ch4-p44-findings.md` verbatim, loop summary `audits/ch4-p44-resolutions.md`). Minors swept, both in `mem_LOGSPACE_of_logspaceReducible`'s sketch: the characteristic function's length language is **exactly** `{pairEncode x []}` (regular, not total), and the index-`0` step is a **paired-input** specialization on `dbl x ++ [false, true]`, proved directly (no circularity). Note-4 accuracy edit: the P0 unique-terminal caveat is *assigned* to `PATH_NLComplete`'s fill, not already closed (`cleanTM` does not reset the input head). Carried: the `comp` query ledger, the counting-verifier disciplines (ascending order, exact counts, direction-sensitive negative test), `mem_NL_of_logspaceReducible` as a future additive statement | Recorded |
| **P4.3 round 1: FAIL — gate open** (2026-10-08: **1 blocker / 4 majors / 4 minors / 3 notes** — `audits/ch4-p43-findings.md` verbatim). The blocker: `exists_adjacency_codec_cnf` was **false as stated** — fixed-length injective codes on *full* configurations are impossible, the output tape being unbounded (the auditor's pigeonhole at `n = s = 0`). **Repairs landed same day**: the codec restated over the quotient carrier (input + `Turing.NDTM.coreSum`) with the new `Turing.Cfg.InWindow`, in-package validity/adjacency/acceptance CNFs (the junk-midpoint guard), serialized-length size bounds (the empty-clause gap), and cross-input rejection; the hardness sketch rebuilt (`Valid`-guarded ψ with the `a = b ∨ Next` base, Tseitin-after-prefix, the **uniform emitter declared a private fill obligation** — the existential is not an algorithm); `space_universal`'s sketch now tests visited-interval **cardinality** with probe-then-replay output; `space_hierarchy`'s sketch now uses the **capped increasing-budget loop** with one fixed padded code and names the space-preserving normal form; membership validates the whole encoding before any verdict; `Games.determined`'s value fixed to the player-one perspective; the padding sketch concretized. Re-audit round per `workflow.md` §3; pack `audits/ch4-p43-r2-pack.md` | Recorded |
| **P4.3 round-2 pack out** (2026-10-08): `audits/ch4-p43-r2-{pack,bundle}.md` — re-audit of the round-1 repairs at `aa02db41`, per-finding disposition table, the complete repair diff attached (`audits/evidence/ch4-p43-r2-repairs.diff`: one statement restated, one definition added, six sketches + one docstring bullet rewritten; every other declaration byte-identical). Bundle sha256 `beb69f18…`, 32 attachments (round-1 findings verbatim, the closed P4.2 resolutions as the updated layering context, fresh r2 sweep 12/0 and lint 0 FAIL over 5+2+42 files). Gate closes on zero blockers/majors | Recorded |
| **P3.3 statement-gate pack out** (2026-10-08): `audits/ch3-p33-{pack,bundle}.md` — 7 statements (NDCodes 1, NTimeHierarchy 6), 7 definitions, one declared skeleton-time proof (`NDMachineCode.decode_encode`, mirror of proved infrastructure). Audited at `a664c3e4`, files byte-identical to landing `72718693`; fresh sweep 7/0, lint 0 FAIL (Diagonalization 0 WARN over 4 files; TuringMachine the 8 pre-existing size WARNs over 39). **Closed-surfaces-only layering** — no sorried concurrent statement is consumed; §12 cited as fill engine only; root-wired (Diagonalization facade frozen under live P3.2, TuringMachine facade untouched). Ten declared deviations incl. the two-work-tape normal form, the iff-packaged unconditional clock, the fused linear clock vs `timed_universal`'s `C·(t+1)²`, the unbounded backward transfer, the `f n` domination addend, and the no-`|x|` budgets. Bundle sha256 `45339e25…`, 23 attachments (incl. `Universal.lean` and `MathlibBridge.lean` as mirror/contrast context, per the P4.1 erratum lesson). Gate closes on zero blockers/majors | Recorded |
| **Four rounds returned, all FAIL** (2026-10-08/09, findings verbatim in `audits/{routine-infra,ch3-p32,ch4-p43-r2,ch3-p33}-findings.md`): **§12** 0 blockers / 4 majors (R1 the closed embeddings cannot express the halt-to-live return — the final emission is lost either way, formal trace supplied; R2 seam composition exports canonical-endpoint theorems only, cannot consume arbitrary frames or output-carrying seams; R3 the first-return cut excludes positive entry-equals-exit calls — a fresh-entry/release adapter is needed; R4 `pairMapSnd`'s documented witness is refuted — the capture tape visits output-length cells, a forwarding controller is commissioned); **P3.2** 1 blocker (`EXPCOM` over the arbitrary `TimeHierarchy.code`: `EffectiveMachineCode` bounds no decoding time, and a tagged scheme embeds an arbitrarily hard decidable language into decoding — statements 9-12 unprovable as stated; the locality layer, stage construction, and the BGS existential all survive); **P4.3 r2** 1 blocker (the serialized-size bound `C·(s+n+1)^C` is self-contradictory at `n = s = 0`: the code width equals `C` while one literal reading the second block already serializes to `C + 6`; all four round-1 majors otherwise resolved); **P3.3** 0 blockers / 2 majors (both in `ntime_hierarchy`'s sketch: the per-code universal constant cannot be absorbed by padded-index choice — padding preserves `decode` but no law preserves cost — and the ladder locator as sketched is not computable within the allowance). No headline theorem refuted anywhere; every verdict names its repair route. Repairs follow per phase | Recorded |
| **Four repair batches landed and four re-audit packs out** (2026-10-09, audited at `9a92fa1a`): **§12 r2** — the returning embeddings `embedSilentRetTM`/`embedEmitRetTM` (halt-to-live through-halt contracts), the general-configuration seam theorems (`seamCompTM_run_ofCfg` + first-return + visited), the `seamReleaseTM` fresh-entry adapter, the forwarding `pairMapSnd` controller, three minor sketch repairs; 47 → **56 sorried** (`audits/routine-infra-r2-{pack,bundle}.md`, sha256 `fc7afcb8…`, 20 attachments); `Build/Catalog.lean` crosses 1000 lines — justified by the queued per-theme split (backlog §2, decision 12.2c). **P3.2 r2** — `Turing.UniformMachineCode` (bounded-acceptance simulator at one polynomial in code+input+deadline jointly), sorried existence, `EXPCOM` redefined over the chosen scheme (choice-over-sorried-existence declared); 17 → **18 sorried** (`audits/ch3-p32-r2-{pack,bundle}.md`, sha256 `9de1defa…`, 24 attachments, `Universal`/`MathlibBridge`/`CodeParser` attached per the round-1 request). **P4.3 r3** — serialized-size bounds to base `s+n+2`, the quotient clause an iff, five wordings; r2-pack "equal codes required" erratum acknowledged (`audits/ch4-p43-r3-{pack,bundle}.md`, sha256 `6a04a9cc…`, 33 attachments). **P3.3 r2** — the hierarchy sketch rebuilt (fixed-code schedule `pair(j,r)`, `f`-adaptive tower ladder with capped-comparison locating, self-clocked interpreter at uniform `K·(g n + 1)`, both transfer instantiations), six sketch corrections; round-1 pack's `g 0 = 0` claim acknowledged as erratum (`audits/ch3-p33-r2-{pack,bundle}.md`, sha256 `fedeadf8…`, 25 attachments). Fresh sweeps 56/18/12/7 with 0 errors at `9a92fa1a`; combined lint 0 FAIL. Four rounds live again | Recorded |
| **P4.3 gate CLOSED** (round 3, 2026-10-09: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 0 minors / 2 notes** — `audits/ch4-p43-r3-findings.md` verbatim; loop summary `audits/ch4-p43-resolutions.md`, the campaign's first three-round statement loop). The amended `s+n+2` base verified with one shared constant uniformly; the factorization iff and all five wordings accepted; no sweeps. Carried: the uniform-emitter family and the quotient path lift as private hardness-fill obligations; the probe-then-replay universal and capped increasing-budget hierarchy disciplines. **Chapter 4 fully closed at the statement level** | Recorded |
| **§12 round 2: FAIL — repaired, round-3 pack out** (2026-10-09: **1 blocker / 0 majors / 0 minors / 1 note** — `audits/routine-infra-r2-findings.md` verbatim; the seven other new contracts and all round-1 dispositions accepted, S7/S8/S9 replayed successfully). The blocker: both through-halt contracts were false at `T = 0` for an initially halted configuration (the handover projection demands `none = some (Sum.inr ())`). Repair at `2b82cbb3`: `(hc : c.state ≠ none)` on both — equivalent to `0 < T` under the first-halt hypothesis — with the counterexample recorded in the docstring. The round-2 pack's 6+3 inventory subdivision acknowledged as an erratum (5 run/first-return + 4 visited-set). Round-3 pack `audits/routine-infra-r3-{pack,bundle}.md` (bundle sha256 `bb651440…`, 21 attachments, the 38-line diff attached); fresh sweep 56/0, lint 0 FAIL. **The §12 round is the campaign's last open statement gate** | Recorded |
| **§12 gate CLOSED** (round 3, 2026-10-09: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 1 minor / 0 notes** — `audits/routine-infra-r3-findings.md` verbatim; loop summary `audits/routine-infra-resolutions.md`, a three-round loop). The round-2 counterexample verified excluded, the full positive-time through-halt induction supplied, consumers discharge `hc` at every live seam, byte-identity confirmed to blob hashes. Minor swept: the `hc ↔ 0 < T` equivalence stated under **both** first-halt hypotheses (forward `hhalt`, reverse `hlive 0`); two pack errata acknowledged in the resolutions. **Facade wiring**: `Build/{Embed,Seam,Catalog}.lean` join `TuringMachine.lean`, root temporary imports removed. **EVERY STATEMENT GATE OF THE CAMPAIGN IS NOW CLOSED** (P0, P3.1-P3.3, P4.1-P4.4, §12); remaining statement work: P3.4 (Ladner, backlog); next: fill epochs | Recorded |
| **Post-statement-program roadmap and §12 fill partition recorded** (user-directed, 2026-10-09): new plan sections **§4b** (the six remaining stages: fill prerequisites — §12 fill, ARM extensions with the colleague sync, Hennie-Stearns + two-tape universal; the fill epochs on the §6 summit order; P3.4 on hold; the ch1-2 retrofit alongside; closure; one PR per chapter) and **§4c** (the routine-layer fill partition: **epoch F1**, 3 parallel disjoint-file batches — F1A Embed 13, F1B Seam 11 general-trio-first, F1C Catalog Part 1 + W1/W2 13 — then **epoch F2**, F2A the 19 Part-2 space rows risk-ordered with the `pairMapSnd` forwarding controller as summit; audit at each epoch boundary; briefs embed the audit-inherited proof plans verbatim). P3.4 explicitly held (user, 2026-10-09) | Recorded |
| **Epoch-F1 briefs issued** (2026-10-09): `briefs/routine-f1-batch{A,B,C}.md` per the §4c partition — A: `Build/Embed.lean`, 13 targets, the round-3 through-halt induction embedded verbatim as the binding plan; B: `Build/Seam.lean`, 11 targets, general-configuration trio first with the round-2 lockstep identities and the `ofWords`/`mapState` substitution embedded; C: `Build/Catalog.lean` Part 1 + W1/W2, 13 targets, the round-1 exact movement-count table embedded with the slack/trajectory clarifications, the 19 epoch-F2 rows explicitly frozen-in-place (final sweep must show exactly 19 sorry warnings). All three: hardened repo/branch headers (issued at `f7f4f0f7`), zip delivery, D1 axiom wording (at-most-triple, no `sorryAx`), continuation-budget clauses. Batches dispatched by the maintainer in parallel chats | Recorded |
| **Epoch F1 integrated** (2026-10-09): all three batches returned complete and verified — A 13/13 (`Build/Embed.lean` now zero-sorry; 14 private additions incl. the `embedThroughHalt` core), B 11/11 (`Build/Seam.lean` zero-sorry; general cores with canonical instances, 13 privates), C 13/13 (`Build/Catalog.lean` Part 1 + W1/W2; **exactly 19 F2 sorries remain, byte-identical**; the `catalogTrace` full-configuration traces). Maintainer verification: SHA256SUMS 15/12/14 OK; each patch touches only its owned file; mechanical freeze audit — every removed line a `sorry` body plus two flagged Fill appendices in A; fresh replay sweep 0 errors (`audits/logs/routine-f1-integration-sweep.log`); **37/37 independent axiom prints** at most the standard triple, zero `sorryAx` (`audits/logs/routine-f1-axioms.log`); lint 0 FAIL. Integration by `git am -3`, Codex authorship preserved (d20ab758, a5012741, 2f67e910). Agent reports archived under `audits/routine-f1-agent-reports/`; patches under `audits/evidence/`. Deliveries also contained environment-shim C files (LD_PRELOAD `/proc/self/exe` workarounds per their reports) — **excluded per the standing instruction**: not compiled, not run, not integrated, unreferenced by the patches. C's requested shared lemma (a public `redirectTM` head-trajectory projection) recorded for the natural-home queue. The F1 epoch-boundary audit pack follows | Recorded |
| **Epoch-F1 fill-gate pack out** (2026-10-09): `audits/routine-f1-{pack,bundle}.md` — the epoch audit over the 37 kernel-checked fills: blind restatement of the sixty new private declarations (A 14, B 13, C 33), contract fidelity against the binding inherited plans, the declared anomalies (A's two unused-`hcap` warnings on frozen signatures; the two Fill appendices; C's shared-lemma request; the excluded environment-shim C files), and drift verification against the attached patch series. Bundle sha256 `b610b75e…`, 22 attachments (the three agent reports and patches verbatim, the maintainer's independent sweep/axiom/lint logs). Gate closes on zero blockers/majors; epoch F2 dispatches at its close | Recorded |
| **P3.2 gate CLOSED** (round 2, 2026-10-09: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 2 minors / 1 note** — `audits/ch3-p32-r2-findings.md` verbatim; loop summary `audits/ch3-p32-resolutions.md`). Both round-1 counterconstructions verified to violate the new `UniformMachineCode` clauses; `exists_uniformMachineCode` confirmed true by the auditor's independent polynomial construction over the concrete grammar (adopted into the sketch — minor R2-1: the received compiler route is arbitrary-time, no received polynomial ledger is claimed); "four-coordinate pairing" wording (R2-2). Carried: the fill-gate axiom-closure check for the choice-over-sorried-existence chain. **Natural-home promotions into the P3.1 files unblocked** | Recorded |
| **P3.3 gate CLOSED** (round 2, 2026-10-09: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 2 minors / 2 notes** — `audits/ch3-p33-r2-findings.md` verbatim; loop summary `audits/ch3-p33-resolutions.md`). Both round-1 majors closed (fixed-code repetition; the concrete O(n) capped locator, no monotonicity needed). Minors swept: the ladder pinned (`ℓ₀ := 2` seed, the source formula authoritative — round-2 pack paraphrase acknowledged as an offset erratum) and the clock-allowance split stated with the interpreter prefix-bound obligation; the stage-bottom comparison attributed to the square (note 3). **Facade rewiring**: `NDCodes` joins `TuringMachine.lean`, `NTimeHierarchy` joins `Diagonalization.lean` (P3.2+P3.3 both closed), the root's two temporary imports removed; `Robustness/Bidirectional` added to the scratch tree (facade sweep gap). **Every drafted phase of the chapter-3/4 statement program is now gated closed except the §12 routine layer**; P3.4 (Ladner) remains the sole undrafted phase | Recorded |
| CH34-Q4 answered (user, 2026-10-08): **EXPCOM route** for the `A` half of Thm 3.7 — Ex 3.6(3) promoted to core, the `NP^EXPCOM ⊆ EXP` simulator added to the summit list (continuation budget certain); [BGS75, Thm 1]'s self-referential oracle recorded as fallback | Decided |
| **P0 reception audit, round 1** (2026-10-08, `audits/ch34-p0-findings.md`, verbatim): **0 blockers, 1 major, 7 minors, 2 notes — gate does not close**; repairs + re-audit round per `workflow.md` §3. The auditor confirmed the time-hierarchy family, `configBound`, `LOGSPACE_subset_P`, the compiler contracts and the index encoding under their actual hypotheses | Recorded |
| **Round-1 major repaired** (finding 1, maintainer-verified: `visitedByTapeHead` images a nonempty range, so `k ≤ spaceUsed` always; one zero of `s` collapses `SPACE s` to the zero-work-tape class): positive-bound convention adopted (§2.4), Ex 3.2 restated at `SPACE(n+1)`, documented in `SpaceComplexity/Basic.lean`, sanity layer `SpaceComplexity/ZeroSpace.lean` added (S1-S6, sorried statements). Minors swept: `sim_run` headline + S9 statement (`sim_run_of_regs_le`), `Mode`/`callSegs` zero-argument qualifier, `valP`/`valQ` canonical payloads, `lenEq`/`lenLe` totalization note, `ReachesB` strict-endpoint wording, `ARMSim`/`Compile`/`Layout` export-list corrections; finding 7 (sweep-log provenance) repaired by a fresh sweep whose log records its revision at start. Notes 9-10 require no change | Recorded |
| CH34-Q8 answered (user, 2026-10-08): the universal NDTM is built at **linear overhead** (guess-then-verify), so Thm 3.2 lands at book strength `f(n+1) = o(g(n))` | Decided |
| CH34-Q4 research (2026-10-08): the machine-light oracle `A = K(A)` **is** [BGS75]'s own Theorem 1 (verified against the scanned original, pp. 433-434), so no deviation from the primary source; [AB09]'s `EXPCOM` is the substitution. Awaiting maintainer confirmation of the route | Recorded |
| Citation audit (2026-10-08), prompted by the maintainer: no missing code-inspiration citation found in campaign-authored Lean code — vendored cslib files carry full headers (pin `a3747758`), `Composition.lean` cites [Balbach22], `Build/*` + `machine-library-design.md` §1-11 were frozen 2026-10-03, two days **before** the first Bonnet examination (2026-10-05, scratchpad-only, never imported; backlog records the after-the-fact cost comparison as convergence). No brief ever carried external code. Hydroxyi's `TimeHierarchy//SpaceComplexity//PolyHierarchy/` trees cite only [AB09]; two design similarities flagged to *ask* (not assertions): `LogProg` compiler vs lax-434930's `TimeCompiler`; `ConfigCount.core` vs cslib `ConfigBound`'s `Cfg.core` (upstream 2026-09-14). §12 citation duty ([lax-434930], Apache-2.0) remains binding when that design is written | Recorded |
