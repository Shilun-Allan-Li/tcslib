# Formalization Plan: Arora-Barak Chapters 3-4 — Diagonalization and Space Complexity

**Status: draft for maintainer review (2026-10-08).** Nothing below is decided until the
open questions in §7 are answered; the decision log (§8) records every row as *Proposed*.

Continuation of the Arora-Barak campaign (`AroraBarakChapter1Plan.md`,
`AroraBarakChapter2Plan.md`, both closed), now working from `main`: branch
`complexity/arora-barak-ch3-4`, created from `origin/main` at `99b187fc`. The methodology
is unchanged (`workflow.md`): audited statement phases with proof sketches,
cross-vendor LLM audit gates closing on zero blockers/majors, then fill epochs of
disjoint-ownership batches with zip delivery, drift attestations, and a blueprint
increment at closure. Artifact names: `audits/ch3-*`, `audits/ch4-*`, `briefs/ch3-*`,
`briefs/ch4-*`.

**What changed since Chapter 2.** Much of this plan's raw material already exists on
`main`, written by Hydroxyi (commit `f70c57c2`, 2026-10-06, sorry-free) — notably a time
hierarchy theorem, `P ⊊ EXP`, `SPACE`/`LOGSPACE`, implicitly logspace functions,
`LOGSPACE ⊆ P`, and a logspace register-machine compiler. The plan therefore starts with
a *reception* phase (§4, P0) that brings that surface under the campaign's audit, and
builds Chapter 4 on Hydroxyi's program layers rather than on hand-built machines.

## 1. Scope

Sources: [AB09] ch. 3, pp. 68-77; ch. 4, pp. 78-94. "Exists" means proved on `main`
today; tiers are **core** (this campaign), **core-late** (this campaign, last, and the
first candidates to descope), **deferred** (backlog).

## 2. Foundation decisions (proposed; each is seeded to the relevant audit)

### 2.1 Thm 3.1 is received at `f²` strength, then strengthened to book form

Hydroxyi's theorem consumes the linear-time `Turing.universal` over one-work-tape codes,
so converting an arbitrary machine to that normal form costs a square. The book's
`f log f` needs the Hennie-Stearns `O(T log T)` simulation ([AB09] §1.7), which the
Chapter-1 plan deferred as phase 5. The received form still yields `P ⊊ EXP`, but **not**
the book's illustrative `DTIME(n) ⊊ DTIME(n^1.5)`, since `n²` exceeds `n^1.5`.

**Decision (user, 2026-10-08, CH34-Q3): strengthen.** Before the chapter-3/4 fill
epochs, the campaign builds (a) the Hennie-Stearns `k`-work-tapes-to-2 conversion at
`C·T log T` ([AB09] §1.7: parallel tracks, buffer zones of size `2^i`, amortized
shifts), and (b) a universal machine over *two-work-tape* codes at linear overhead.
Hydroxyi's diagonal argument then re-derives Thm 3.1 at `f log f`, and Theorem 1.9
reaches book strength, closing chapter 1's deferred phase 5. Until that lands, the
received form is documented as delivered strength, never as Thm 3.1 verbatim. Both
constructions are consumers of the machine-routine layer (§4a).

### 2.2 Oracle classes

- **A finite bundle `FinOracleTM`** carrying `Fintype`/`DecidableEq` for states, with
  `WellFormed` as a field. This is the Chapter-1 phase-1 obligation: "oracle complexity
  classes will introduce a finite oracle-machine bundle".
- **An oracle NDTM** combining the binary-choice NDTM with the oracle step. Def 3.4 says
  only that nondeterministic oracle machines are "defined similarly".
- **`Pᴼ` and `NPᴼ` mirror `P` and `NTIME`** literally: the same `c · T n` and
  `n^c + 1` normal forms, with all-branch halting for `NPᴼ`.
- **Query tape:** the existing persistent convention (no auto-erase). The Chapter-1
  obligation to prove polynomial equivalence with the auto-erased convention is scheduled
  only if some consumer imports an invariance; none in this plan does.
- **One general lemma does most of the light work:** `L ≤ₚ O ⇒ L ∈ Pᴼ`. It writes `f(x)`
  on the query tape, queries, and copies the answer. Ex 3.6(1), the `A` half of Thm 3.7,
  and `NP ⊆ P^SAT` all follow from it.

### 2.3 Baker-Gill-Solovay

- **The `B` half follows the book.** `U_B ∈ NP^B` is a small oracle-NDTM construction.
  `U_B ∉ P^B` is the stage construction. It is mathematics, not machine-building: runs
  that agree on every queried string agree (by lockstep); a run of `t` steps queries at
  most `t` strings, each of length at most `t` (`queryString_length_le` exists); and
  `FinOracleTM`s can be enumerated with every machine recurring infinitely often, through
  `Fintype.equivFin` plus state relabelling, with no universal oracle machine needed.
- **The `A` half is a route decision (CH34-Q4).**
  - The book's route uses `A = EXPCOM` via Ex 3.6(3). `EXP ⊆ P^EXPCOM` is cheap through
    the §2.2 lemma, but `NP^EXPCOM ⊆ EXP` needs an exponential-time deterministic
    simulation of oracle NDTMs that answers `EXPCOM` queries by clocked universal
    simulation. That is a summit-sized machine.
  - The alternative is a self-referential oracle: `A = {⟨N, x, 1ᵗ⟩ : N^A accepts x within
    t steps}`. It is well-defined by recursion on length, because a `t`-step run queries
    only strings shorter than `⟨N, x, 1ᵗ⟩`. Then `NPᴬ ⊆ Pᴬ` takes one query through the
    §2.2 lemma. This is machine-light, but it deviates from the book, and a published
    attribution must still be sourced (policy §2).

### 2.4 Space

- **Reuse `SPACE` and `LOGSPACE` unchanged**: deterministic, halting, counting visited
  work cells summed over the work tapes, with input and output excluded. [AB09] is itself
  inconsistent here: Def 4.1 counts *visited* cells for `SPACE` but *non-blank* cells for
  `NSPACE`. The vendored `Deterministic.lean` docstring and `SpaceComplexity/Basic.lean`
  currently disagree about what [AB09] says. P0 fixes the documentation, and the visited
  measure is used for both classes.
- **`NSPACE` (CH34-Q7, provisional answer: all branches halt).** It needs a new NDTM space
  measure along `runWith`, adapting the `visitedByTapeHead` pattern to choice words.
  Provisionally, `N` decides `L` in space `s` if on every input there is some `T` with
  `HaltsWithin x T`, every choice word stays within `s(|x|)` cells, and `x ∈ L` iff some
  choice word accepts. All-branch halting matches `NTIME`, lax-434930's convention and
  Remark 4.3's alternative, and it makes the configuration-count arguments direct.
- **Space-constructibility mirrors `TimeConstructible`.** A machine writes
  `(S |x|).bits` within space `c · (S |x|)`, and the definition carries
  `∀ n, logSpace n ≤ S n`, which is [AB09]'s standing `S(n) > log n` (p. 79).
  Theorems needing only weaker hypotheses say so. This is seeded to the P4.1 audit.
- **The classes:** `PSPACE := ⋃ c, SPACE (n^c + 1)`, and likewise `NPSPACE`;
  `NL := NSPACE logSpace`; `coNL` in complement form, like `coNP`.
- **`≤ₗ` reuses `ImplicitlyLogspaceComputable`** (Def 4.16, with its documented
  divergences: `C(|x|+1)^c` length bound and 0-based index).

### 2.5 Machine substrate for Chapter 4: program layers, not hand-built machines

Chapter 2's lesson, and the backlog's machine-routine-layer entry, is that hand-built
machines dominate the cost. For space the relevant layers already exist on `main`:

- **`LogProg.ARM`** (`SpaceComplexity/Machines/`) is an abstract register machine with
  `O(log n)`-bit registers and calls to `LOGSPACE` deciders. It compiles to `FinTM` with a
  space theorem (`compile_space`, `arm_decides`, `arm_decides_poly`). It is
  **deterministic only**.
- **`CounterProg`** (`TuringMachine/CounterProg{,Run}.lean`) has unary registers and
  forward input reading. It compiles with a time bound (`t` steps become at most
  `t(2t+3)`), so it suits the `2^O(S)`-time searches, where register values of size
  `2^O(S)` are affordable. Its input is one-way (`rd` only advances), but a configuration
  successor must read the input at the simulated head. Those searches therefore need
  either ARM-style indexed input access or a rewind instruction.

Proposed extensions, each a P4.x infrastructure statement with its own audit:

1. **A nondeterministic ARM**: a `choose` instruction compiling to `FinNDTM`, with the
   space theorem carried over. This serves `PATH ∈ NL`, Immerman-Szelepcsényi and
   Cor 4.21.
2. **A polynomial-width ARM variant** with registers of `poly(n)` bits, for the
   `PSPACE`-level algorithms: `TQBF ∈ PSPACE`, `NP ⊆ PSPACE`, Savitch at polynomial
   level. It is either a generalization of `compile_space` or a sibling.
3. **A configuration codec**, shared by Thm 4.2(iii), Savitch, Thm 4.18, Cor 4.21 and
   `TQBF` hardness. It encodes the configurations of a fixed machine, with work tapes
   windowed to `s` cells and the input head as a separate register, as `O(s)`-bit
   register contents, and provides a successor/adjacency test as a program. The counting
   half adapts cslib's new upstream `MultiTape/ConfigBound.lean` design (Sept 2026,
   `Storage`/`Cfg.core`) and extends Hydroxyi's deterministic `ConfigCount` to NDTMs.
   It must be cited and adapted, not vendored: cslib targets a newer Lean with the
   module system.

This requires Hydroxyi's agreement, since these are their modules (CH34-Q2).

### 2.6 Formulas and graphs

- **The QBF matrix (CH34-Q5).** Def 4.10 allows a general unquantified matrix; we have
  only `Std.Sat.CNF ℕ` and the DNF dual. Provisional choice: prenex QBF with a **CNF
  matrix**, reusing the CNF carrier, serialization and parser. [AB09] notes on p. 83 that
  the CNF restriction is harmless via auxiliary variables, so `TQBF` hardness pays a
  Tseitin step. A general-formula carrier is the alternative, which Chapter 5 and a
  general `TAUTOLOGY` would also want.
- **`PATH` needs the campaign's first graph encoding**: an adjacency-matrix
  serialization plus `s`, `t` in binary via `pairEncode`, with a parser and the
  `codeFallback`-style totalization. It stays in-house in `Complexity/`, with
  `GraphTheory.Digraph.Reachable` as the semantic target.

### 2.7 Universal machines

- **Thm 4.8 needs a space-efficient universal machine (Ex 4.1).** The existing `universal`
  and `timed_universal` are time-only, and their code scheme covers only the
  one-work-tape binary normal form. So either the Chapter-1 robustness conversions
  (`one_work_tape`, alphabet reduction) gain space theorems, or a fresh space-universal
  machine takes multi-tape codes. This is the largest single risk in Chapter 4 (§6).
- **Thm 3.2 needs NDTM codes and a clocked universal NDTM (Ex 2.6), at linear
  overhead** (user decision 2026-10-08, CH34-Q8). Polynomial overhead would deliver only
  `f(n+1)^c = o(g(n))`; linear overhead gives the book's `f(n+1) = o(g(n))`. The
  guess-then-verify technique (guess the whole tableau of choice/configuration data,
  then check each tape's consistency in one pass — Book-Greibach style) achieves a
  code-dependent constant factor, which is the strongest form possible: a simulation of
  `t` steps cannot run faster than the `t` steps it reproduces, and the code-dependent
  constant is necessary for the same reason as chapter 1's Argument E. Another
  routine-layer consumer.

## 3. Architecture and module layout

New campaign directories (namespace `Complexity`, facades per policy §1):

| Directory | Contents |
|---|---|
| `TuringMachine/OracleFinite.lean`, `TuringMachine/OracleNondeterministic.lean` | `FinOracleTM`, oracle NDTM, runs, and lockstep embeddings of plain machines |
| `ClassOracle/` | `Pᴼ`, `NPᴼ`, the `≤ₚ ⇒ Pᴼ` lemma, Ex 3.6, oracle-machine enumeration, `Relativization.lean` (Thm 3.7) |
| `Diagonalization/` | `NTimeHierarchy.lean` (Thm 3.2), `Ladner.lean` (Thm 3.3), `NotTimeConstructible.lean` (Ex 3.5) |
| `TuringMachine/NondeterministicSpace.lean`, `TuringMachine/NDCodes.lean` | NDTM space measure; NDTM codes and the universal NDTM |
| `SpaceComplexity/` (extending Hydroxyi's tree, subject to CH34-Q2) | `NSPACE.lean`, `Classes.lean` (`PSPACE`/`NPSPACE`/`NL`/`coNL`), `Constructible.lean`, `Inclusions.lean` (Thm 4.2), `ConfigGraph.lean`, `Savitch.lean`, `Hierarchy.lean`, `Logspace/{Reductions,Path,ImmermanSzelepcsenyi}.lean` |
| `Formulas/QBF.lean`, `Formulas/QBFEncoding.lean`; `ClassPSPACE/TQBF.lean` | the QBF carrier and serialization; Thm 4.13 |

Chapter-1/2 files stay frozen at their audited surface. Additions to Hydroxyi's trees
follow whatever ownership rule CH34-Q2 sets.

## 4. Phasing

Statement phases, each gated by an audit before the next one lands. The order reflects
infrastructure dependencies and retires risk early: the light half of Chapter 3, then
Chapter 4, then Chapter 3's two heavy diagonalizations.

| Phase | Contents | New sorried statements (est.) |
|---|---|---|
| **P0 — Reception** | Statements-only audit of the existing surface the campaign will build on: `time_hierarchy`, `P_ssubset_EXP`, `SPACE`, `LOGSPACE`, `ImplicitlyLogspaceComputable`, `LOGSPACE_subset_P`, `ComputesInTime.of_spaceUsed_le`, and the `arm_decides` and `compile_space` contracts. Docstring fixes (the §2.4 inconsistency; the stale "spec phase, sorried" notes in `Build/*`). Drift baseline recorded. No new sorries. | 0 |
| **P3.1 — Oracle classes** | `FinOracleTM`, the oracle NDTM, `Pᴼ`, `NPᴼ`; `P ⊆ Pᴼ`, `NPᴼ` contains `Pᴼ`; the `≤ₚ ⇒ Pᴼ` lemma; Ex 3.6(1)(2); `NP ⊆ P^SAT` as a sanity theorem | ~10 |
| **P3.2 — Relativization** | Oracle-machine enumeration; `U_B ∈ NP^B`; the stage construction; Thm 3.7; the `A` half per CH34-Q4; Ex 3.5 | ~8 |
| **P4.1 — Space classes** | NDTM space measure, `NSPACE`, space-constructibility, the classes; Thm 4.2(i)(ii); `L ⊆ NL`; `3SAT ∈ PSPACE`, `NP ⊆ PSPACE`; `EVEN`, `MULT ∈ L`; the nondeterministic and polynomial-width ARM interfaces | ~14 |
| **P4.2 — Configuration graphs** | The configuration codec; Claim 4.4(1) for NDTMs; Thm 4.2(iii); Savitch; `PSPACE = NPSPACE`; `NL ⊆ P`; Ex 4.3 | ~10 |
| **P4.3 — `PSPACE`-completeness and space hierarchy** | Def 4.9; the QBF carrier, `TQBF`, Claim 4.4(2), Thm 4.13 (both halves); the space-universal machine (Ex 4.1); Thm 4.8; `L ⊊ PSPACE`; Ex 3.2; Ex 4.10 | ~12 |
| **P4.4 — Logspace and `NL`** | `≤ₗ`, `NL`-completeness, Lemma 4.17; the graph encoding, `PATH ∈ NL`, Thm 4.18; Thm 4.20; Cor 4.21 | ~10 |
| **P3.3 — Nondeterministic hierarchy** | NDTM codes, the clocked universal NDTM (Ex 2.6), Thm 3.2 at delivered strength | ~6 |
| **P3.4 — Ladner** | `SAT_H`; Ex 3.6(a) (`H` in polynomial time); the Claim; Ex 3.6(b); Thm 3.3 | ~6 |

That is roughly 75 new audited statements, against Chapter 2's 59.

### 4a. Pre-campaign infrastructure (user decisions 2026-10-08)

The machine-routine layer and its two headline consumers run **in parallel with the
statement phases**, and gate only the fill epochs:

1. **The routine layer** (`machine-library-design.md` §12, to be written): bank
   embedding, seam composition, catalog promotion — **scoped to amply support the
   chapter-1/2 retrofit**, not just the new consumers. Its catalog therefore covers the
   privately re-derived bank / relocation / dispatch / frame families of `Build/*`,
   `Universal*`, and `CookLevin/Hardness.lean` (the backlog retrofit entry's list), and
   **every routine carries a space cost alongside its time cost** from the start, so
   chapter 4 and the space statements (P4.x) can consume it without a second pass. The
   P0/P4.1 space statements are drafted while the layer is being designed, precisely so
   they can inform what else the layer needs (CH34-Q1).
2. **Hennie-Stearns + the two-work-tape universal machine** (§2.1): the layer's first
   new consumers, giving Thms 1.9 and 3.1 at book strength. The two-tape universal is a
   rewrite of `Universal.lean`, making it the natural retrofit pilot. Candidate bonus,
   to be checked at design time: carrying space bounds through it may also yield the
   space-efficient universal machine that Thm 4.8 needs (Ex 4.1).
3. **The chapter-1/2 retrofit** itself is *not* a gate for chapters 3-4: public surfaces
   are frozen, so retrofit batches run alongside the chapter-3/4 phases under the
   standard sweep + traversal + audit protocol.

**Fill campaign.** Fill work starts after the gates close, in epochs ordered by risk as
before. Two infrastructure prerequisites gate the machine-heavy epochs:

- the machine-routine layer as scoped above;
- the ARM extensions of §2.5.

**Integration with `main`.** Proposed: one PR per closed chapter (Chapter 3's light half
may go earlier), not one campaign-sized PR like #3. Main's CI runs only on pushes to
`main`, so each PR carries the local evidence: sweep, axiom prints, and the blueprint web
build.

## 5. Prior art to consult (design only; cite, never transcribe)

- **Édouard Bonnet's Lax Archive entries** (Lean 4.33, Mathlib `db584cd6`). They use a
  different machine model (stack machines, one work tape), so none of their code ports.
  - lax-434930 `classical-complexity` (commit `0c084031…`): `L ⊆ NL ⊆ P ⊆ NP ⊆ PSPACE =
    NPSPACE ⊆ EXPTIME`. Its space model counts every visited work cell, requires every
    branch to halt, and uses `c · log₂(n+2)`. It embeds the lax-307052 Savitch proof.
  - lax-362205 Immerman-Szelepcsényi (`EdouardBonnet/immerman-szelepcsenyi` @
    `e0ffe91e`): inductive counting on finite configuration graphs.
  - lax-783278 Arc Kayles: a machine-to-game `PSPACE`-hardness that bears on the shape of
    the `TQBF` hardness proof.
  - Licences: lax-434930 states Apache-2.0 for its incorporated helpers; the others' pages
    state none. Check each before any design adaptation, under the 2026-10-06 citation
    discipline.
- **cslib upstream** (`leanprover/cslib` `main`): `MultiTape/ConfigBound.lean` and
  `TapeLemmas.lean` (space-bounded configuration counting, `exists_spaceUsedByTape_max`).
  We already diverge from cslib's relational `MultiTapeNTM` (Chapter-2 decision log).
- **Szymon Toruńczyk, lax-218471**: compositional polynomial-time computation with
  black-box subroutines. It bears on the §2.2 `≤ₚ ⇒ Pᴼ` lemma and Ex 3.6(2).

## 6. Risks and honest effort assessment

- **Chapter 4 is the larger half**, and almost all of it is machine work with *space*
  ledgers. Every existing campaign construction (Chapters 1-2, `Build/*`) is time-only,
  and `machine-library-design.md` lists "no space bounds" among its non-goals. Building
  Chapter 4 on hand-built machines would repeat Chapter 2's cost profile several times
  over. The §2.5 program layers are the mitigation, and the plan depends on them.
- **The summits**, in rough order of size:
  1. the space-universal machine plus Thm 4.8 (or space theorems for the Chapter-1
     conversions);
  2. `TQBF` hardness (a polynomial-time emitter of the `ψᵢ` formula, comparable to the
     Cook-Levin emitter);
  3. Ladner's `H` in polynomial time;
  4. the universal NDTM;
  5. Thm 4.2(iii) and Savitch over the configuration codec;
  6. Immerman-Szelepcsényi;
  7. Lemma 4.17.
- **Delivered-strength honesty**: Thms 3.1 and 3.2 land weaker than the book unless
  Hennie-Stearns is built. Every docstring must say so; this was the round-1 lesson of
  every prior audit.
- **Coordination**: Chapter 4 extends a colleague's live tree, and the plan needs their
  agreement before P4.1.
- **Estimated scale**: roughly 75 statements over eight statement phases plus P0. The
  total is larger than Chapter 2; Chapter 3 alone is comparable to Chapter 1.

## 7. Open design questions (human review required)

Answered 2026-10-08 by the maintainer except where marked open; the register below is
the record, and `backlog.md` §1 gets only the open ones.

1. **CH34-Q1 — sequencing against the machine-routine layer.** **Answered: yes to
   both.** Statement phases run in parallel with the §12 design; the space statements
   are drafted early to inform the layer's scope; the catalog records space costs
   alongside time. Addendum (same date): the layer is scoped to **amply support the
   chapter-1/2 retrofit** as well (§4a).
2. **CH34-Q2 — alignment with Hydroxyi.** **Answered: extend in place, co-owned.**
3. **CH34-Q3 — Thm 3.1 strength.** **Answered: strengthen** — Hennie-Stearns + the
   two-work-tape universal before the fill epochs (§2.1, §4a).
4. **CH34-Q4 — the `A` half of Thm 3.7.** **Open — explanation delivered, awaiting
   confirmation.** Correction to the first draft: the "self-referential" oracle
   `A = K(A) = {⟨i, x, 0ⁿ⟩ : NPᵢᴬ accepts x in < n steps}` is **the original proof** —
   Baker-Gill-Solovay 1975, Lemma 1 + Theorem 1 (SIAM J. Comput. 4(4), pp. 433-434;
   well-defined because a `< n`-step run queries only strings shorter than `n`); their
   Theorem 2 is the PSPACE-complete-oracle variant, and [AB09]'s `EXPCOM` is a textbook
   substitution. So the machine-light route follows the primary source, cited [BGS75],
   with [AB09]'s Ex 3.6(3) deferred. One detail for the P3.1 audit: [BGS75] requires
   the polynomial clock to hold under *every* oracle, which constrains how `Pᴼ`/`NPᴼ`
   quantify the time bound.
5. **CH34-Q5 — QBF matrix.** **Answered: CNF.**
6. **CH34-Q6 — tiers.** **Answered: Thm 3.2 mandatory; Thm 3.3 (Ladner) core-late.**
7. **CH34-Q7 — `NSPACE` halting convention.** **Answered: all branches halt.**
8. **CH34-Q8 — universal-NDTM overhead.** **Answered (2026-10-08): linear overhead**,
   the strongest form possible (§2.7) — Thm 3.2 lands at the book's
   `f(n+1) = o(g(n))`.

## 8. Decision log

| Decision | Status |
|---|---|
| Chapters 3-4 run as one campaign on `complexity/arora-barak-ch3-4` (from `main` @ `99b187fc`), same methodology as Chapters 1-2; artifacts `ch3-*`/`ch4-*` | Proposed |
| Existing sorry-free Chapter-3/4 material on `main` (Hydroxyi, `f70c57c2`) is received and audited (P0), never duplicated | Proposed |
| Prior-art survey (2026-10-08): repository inventory (§1 tables); Bonnet lax-434930/362205/783278, cslib `ConfigBound`, Toruńczyk lax-218471 (§5) | Recorded |
| Chapter 4 machine work goes through program layers (`LogProg.ARM`, `CounterProg`, proposed extensions §2.5) | Proposed |
| §2 foundation choices and §7 provisional answers | **Answered 2026-10-08** (user): Q1 yes to both, Q2 extend in place co-owned, Q3 strengthen, Q5 CNF, Q6 Thm 3.2 mandatory / Ladner core-late, Q7 all branches halt. Q4 and Q8 open |
| Routine layer set up in parallel with the statement phases, scoped to **amply support the ch-1/2 retrofit** (full bank/relocation/dispatch/frame catalog), with space costs throughout; Hennie-Stearns + two-tape universal as first consumers; retrofit itself not a gate (§4a) | Decided (user, 2026-10-08) |
| CH34-Q8 answered (user, 2026-10-08): the universal NDTM is built at **linear overhead** (guess-then-verify), so Thm 3.2 lands at book strength `f(n+1) = o(g(n))` | Decided |
| CH34-Q4 research (2026-10-08): the machine-light oracle `A = K(A)` **is** [BGS75]'s own Theorem 1 (verified against the scanned original, pp. 433-434), so no deviation from the primary source; [AB09]'s `EXPCOM` is the substitution. Awaiting maintainer confirmation of the route | Recorded |
| Citation audit (2026-10-08), prompted by the maintainer: no missing code-inspiration citation found in campaign-authored Lean code — vendored cslib files carry full headers (pin `a3747758`), `Composition.lean` cites [Balbach22], `Build/*` + `machine-library-design.md` §1-11 were frozen 2026-10-03, two days **before** the first Bonnet examination (2026-10-05, scratchpad-only, never imported; backlog records the after-the-fact cost comparison as convergence). No brief ever carried external code. Hydroxyi's `TimeHierarchy//SpaceComplexity//PolyHierarchy/` trees cite only [AB09]; two design similarities flagged to *ask* (not assertions): `LogProg` compiler vs lax-434930's `TimeCompiler`; `ConfigCount.core` vs cslib `ConfigBound`'s `Cfg.core` (upstream 2026-09-14). §12 citation duty ([lax-434930], Apache-2.0) remains binding when that design is written | Recorded |
