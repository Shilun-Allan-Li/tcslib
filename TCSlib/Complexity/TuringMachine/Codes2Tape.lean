# Deterministic two-work-tape machine codes (Z3)

The deterministic code layer currently covers only the one-work-tape
binary normal form (`Turing.CodeTM`/`Turing.MachineCode`/
`Turing.EffectiveMachineCode`, `Encoding.lean`), which is why the received
time hierarchy arrives at `f²` strength (plan §2.1): converting to that
normal form costs a square. This file is §13's Z3: the **deterministic
two-work-tape** code scheme, the codes the two-work-tape universal machine
(stage 1, plan §4b) reads, over **the same `Turing.actionBits₂` record
format** that `Turing.CodeNDTM` fixed for the nondeterministic two-tape
codes (design §13a: one branch instead of two — never a second
serialization). The file name reads *codes for two-tape machines*
(decision 13.3, renamed from `Codes2` by the user).

Mirrors: `Turing.CodeTM` → `Turing.Code2TM`; `Turing.MachineCode` →
`Turing.MachineCode2`; `Turing.EffectiveMachineCode` →
`Turing.EffectiveMachineCode2`; and, per the P3.2 lesson (a variable-code
consumer needs uniformly timed decoding — `EffectiveMachineCode` bounds no
decoding time), `UniformMachineCode` (`Diagonalization/EXPCOM.lean`) →
`Turing.UniformMachineCode2`.

## Status: statement skeleton (§13 statement phase, tranche A-S2)

The structures and serialization are real definitions; the two existence
statements are `sorry`d with proof sketches naming the received routes.

## Main definitions and results

* `Turing.Code2TM`, `Turing.Code2TM.serialize` — the deterministic
  two-work-tape normal form and its fixed, scheme-independent
  serialization (27 `Turing.actionBits₂` records per state: three input
  reads by three reads on each of the two work tapes).
* `Turing.MachineCode2`, `Turing.EffectiveMachineCode2`,
  `Turing.UniformMachineCode2` — the scheme laws, the effective scheme,
  and the uniformly timed scheme.
* `Turing.exists_effectiveMachineCode2`,
  `Turing.exists_uniformMachineCode2` — the sorried existence statements.

namespace Turing

/-- The coded normal form of a deterministic machine with **two** work
tapes: a binary-alphabet machine with state space `Fin (numStates + 1)`
(never empty). Two work tapes, not one, because the Hennie-Stearns
conversion lands there at `O(T log T)` and the two-tape universal machine
(its consumer) runs such codes at linear overhead — the whole point of
strengthening past `Turing.CodeTM`'s square. Mirrors `Turing.CodeTM` and
`Turing.CodeNDTM`. [AB09, §1.4, §1.7] -/
structure Code2TM where
  /-- one less than the number of states (so the state space is never empty) -/
  numStates : ℕ
  /-- the underlying two-work-tape deterministic machine -/
  tm : MultiTapeTM 2 Bool (Fin (numStates + 1))

/-- The bundled machine of a coded two-tape machine. -/
def Code2TM.toFinTM (M : Code2TM) : FinTM Bool where
  k := 2
  State := Fin (M.numStates + 1)
  tm := M.tm

/-- The **fixed, scheme-independent** canonical serialization, mirroring
`Turing.CodeTM.serialize` and `Turing.CodeNDTM.serialize` over the same
`Turing.actionBits₂` record: the state count, the initial state, then the
full transition table in the fixed enumeration order — states in `Fin`
order, then the input read and the two work reads each over `none`,
`some false`, `some true` (27 records per state; the nondeterministic
table's outermost choice bit is absent). This is the target format of
`Turing.EffectiveMachineCode2.canonizer` and the input format of the
two-work-tape universal machine. -/

  pairEncode (Nat.bits M.numStates)
    (unaryFin M.tm.q₀ ++
      (List.finRange (M.numStates + 1)).flatMap fun q =>

              actionBits₂ (M.tm.tr q inp (workPair w₀ w₁)))

/-- The algebraic laws of a representation scheme for coded two-tape
machines, mirroring `Turing.MachineCode` [AB09, §1.4]: a total decoding
(property 1), an encoding, and recovery under arbitrary `true`-padding
(property 2 — every machine has infinitely many representations). -/
structure MachineCode2 where
  /-- encode a machine as a binary string -/
  encode : Code2TM → List Bool
  /-- decode any binary string to a machine (total by type: property 1) -/
  decode : List Bool → Code2TM
  /-- a code followed by any amount of `true`-padding decodes to the
  machine (property 2) -/
  decode_encode_pad : ∀ M m, decode (encode M ++ List.replicate m true) = M

/-- Decoding a code recovers the machine (padding by zero symbols).
Skeleton-time proof, mirroring `Turing.MachineCode.decode_encode`. -/
theorem MachineCode2.decode_encode (c : MachineCode2) (M : Code2TM) :
    c.decode (c.encode M) = M := by
  simpa using c.decode_encode_pad M 0

/-- An *effective* representation scheme for two-tape machines: the
algebraic laws together with a machine of this development computing the
fixed serialization of the decoded machine — the mirror of
`Turing.EffectiveMachineCode`, with the same Argument-A rationale (the
target `Turing.Code2TM.serialize` is scheme-independent). As there, the
canonizer's time bound is arbitrary: fixed-code consumers absorb it into
their constants, and variable-code consumers must use
`Turing.UniformMachineCode2` instead. -/
structure EffectiveMachineCode2 extends MachineCode2 where
  /-- a machine computing the fixed serialization of the decoded machine -/
  canonizer : FinTM Bool
  /-- the canonizer's (arbitrary) time bound -/
  canonizerTime : ℕ → ℕ
  /-- the canonizer computes `serialize ∘ decode` -/
  canonizer_computes :
    canonizer.ComputesFunInTime (fun α => (decode α).serialize) canonizerTime

/-- **An effective two-tape code scheme exists** (spec, fill pending —
tranche A-S2).

**Proof sketch.** Mirror the received constructions over the
single-branch table: `encode := Code2TM.serialize` itself; `decode`
parses the `Turing.pairEncode`d state count, the initial state, and the
transition table by the received parser architecture
(`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.CodeParser`, retargeted to the
`Turing.actionBits₂` record at **27 records per state** — the
nondeterministic retarget's `2 · 27 = 54` without the choice bit, so its
minimum-length guard scales by exactly half), with the single-state
do-nothing machine as the fallback on parse failure and trailing
`true`-padding tolerated by the end-marker discipline (property 2); the
canonizer re-serializes the parsed record by the arbitrary-time
computability route of the received deterministic construction
(`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.MathlibBridge`), so no polynomial
canonizer is claimed. Fill obligations, named: the record parser and its
fallback totalization; the pad-tolerance lemma; the canonizer assembly
and its time bound. -/

  sorry

/-- A *uniformly timed* scheme for two-tape codes: the effective scheme
together with a bounded-acceptance simulator whose budget is one
polynomial **jointly** in the code length, input length, and time bound —
the mirror of `UniformMachineCode` (`Diagonalization/EXPCOM.lean`), which
exists because `EffectiveMachineCode2` deliberately bounds no decoding
time (the P3.2 lesson: with an arbitrary scheme, a variable-code consumer
can be made to pay unboundedly for decoding). -/
structure UniformMachineCode2 extends EffectiveMachineCode2 where
  /-- the uniformly timed bounded-acceptance simulator -/
  simulator : FinTM Bool
  /-- the simulator's single polynomial degree and coefficient -/
  simDegree : ℕ
  /-- on bounded acceptance, the simulator answers `[true]` within the
  uniform polynomial budget -/
  simulator_accepts : ∀ (α x : List Bool) (t : ℕ),
    (decode α).toFinTM.ComputesInTime x [true] t →
    simulator.ComputesInTime (pairEncode (pairEncode (Nat.bits t) α) x) [true]
      (simDegree * (α.length + x.length + t + 1) ^ simDegree)
  /-- otherwise it answers `[false]` within the same budget -/
  simulator_rejects : ∀ (α x : List Bool) (t : ℕ),
    ¬(decode α).toFinTM.ComputesInTime x [true] t →
    simulator.ComputesInTime (pairEncode (pairEncode (Nat.bits t) α) x) [false]
      (simDegree * (α.length + x.length + t + 1) ^ simDegree)

/-- **A uniformly timed two-tape scheme exists** (spec, fill pending —
tranche A-S2).

**Proof sketch.** The concrete scheme of
`Turing.exists_effectiveMachineCode2` with the uniform simulator built as
in the received `exists_uniformMachineCode` route
(`Diagonalization/EXPCOM.lean`, P3.2 round 2): parse the nested input
keeping the deadline in binary; check the table's minimum-length guard by
binary arithmetic before any per-state iteration (a huge declared state
count is never expanded in unary; the guard constant halves against the
nondeterministic table); then run the clocked step-by-step simulation of
the decoded two-tape machine, charging one uniform polynomial jointly in
`|α| + |x| + t + 1`. The two-work-tape simulation is *easier* than the
received one-tape case for the step itself (the simulator hosts the two
coded tapes on two physical tapes — no tape reduction), and the Z1
virtual-input layer supplies the input discipline. -/
