# Machine-construction library: bank embedding (R1)

The general tape-embedding layer of the machine-construction library
(`machine-library-design.md` §12, R1): a verified routine on its own
`m`-tape set runs on any injectively selected subset of a `k`-tape host's
work tapes, cost unchanged, everything else framed. This is the §5
deferral promoted — the design deferred the general form "until a third
site needs it", and the third, fourth, and fifth sites have arrived (the
chapter-1/2 retrofit families, the Hennie–Stearns conversion, the
two-work-tape universal machine). **Scope, stated precisely** (round-1
note R9): `ι` selects whole distinct physical tapes with coordinates
intact — it does not multiplex several virtual tapes onto zones of one
physical tape, shrink the tape count, or alter the source input word; the
Hennie–Stearns and universal-machine consumers get their zone/virtual-input
representation layers separately, with this module supplying only the
fixed-physical-bank routine relocation. It is the generic form of the private
`emitterBank*`/`emitterP2*` relocation families of
`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Build.Primitives`, of the 4A chain's
`clBank*`/`clSlot*` families, and of the retained-tape disciplines that
`Build/Loop.lean` and `Build/Wrappers.lean` carry internally.

**Status: statement skeleton (§12 statement phase).** The transformers and
configuration transports below are real definitions; every contract is
sorried, each with a proof sketch naming its fill obligations.

## Design

Per frozen decision 12.4 there are **two named transformers over one
shared private core** (`embedActionCore`), so each spec stays crisp and a
consumer cites whichever fits:

* `Turing.embedSilentTM` — the W1/capture flavor: the embedded routine's
  emissions are recorded on a designated host work tape `cap` outside the
  selected bank, and the host's physical output stays silent.
* `Turing.embedEmitTM` — the E2/forwarding flavor: emissions pass to the
  host's physical output verbatim.

The two **closed** transformers preserve the source state type and map
the source halt to the host halt; their lockstep is unguarded, holding at
every time with the step count preserved exactly. The round-1 audit
(finding R1) refuted the earlier claim that live-return dispatch could be
left to the seam combinator: a source whose final transition emits and
halts loses that emission either way — the closed embedding is halted
after it, and a seam exit at the sole live state dispatches *before* it.
The **returning** flavors below repair this with an explicit halt-to-live
adapter built into the action core: `Turing.embedSilentRetTM` and
`Turing.embedEmitRetTM` run the source on states `S ⊕ Unit`, execute every
source action **through the halting transition** — the final emission
included — and land in the live return anchor `Sum.inr ()`, which a seam
then consumes as its left exit (`Turing.captureAction`'s and
`Turing.emitterRightTM`'s halt-to-live discipline, now exported).
`Turing.captureAction`/`Turing.capture_run` and
`Turing.emitAction`/`Turing.emit_run` are the fixed-shape precursors
(last-tape capture, identity selection); their statements are untouched.

## Main definitions

* `Turing.embedSilentCfg`, `Turing.embedEmitCfg` — a source configuration
  transported along `ι : Fin m ↪ Fin k`, with the unselected host tapes
  carried as frame parameters.
* `Turing.embedSilentTM`, `Turing.embedEmitTM` — the two closed machine
  transformers.
* `Turing.embedSilentRetTM`, `Turing.embedEmitRetTM` — the two returning
  transformers (round-1 repair R1): source halts land in the live return
  anchor `Sum.inr ()`, with the halting transition executed in full.

## Main results

All sorried (statement phase):

* `Turing.embedSilentTM_runFrom`, `Turing.embedEmitTM_runFrom` — lockstep:
  the transported run is the transport of the source run, same step count.
* `Turing.embedSilentTM_frame`, `Turing.embedEmitTM_frame` — tapes outside
  `Set.range ι` byte-identical with heads unmoved, input position tracking
  the source, output per flavor.
* `Turing.embedSilentTM_visitedByTapeHead`,
  `Turing.embedEmitTM_visitedByTapeHead` (and `_frame` companions),
  `Turing.embedSilentTM_spaceUsedByTape_cap` — per-tape space: host tape
  `ι i` visits exactly the source's tape-`i` cells, unselected tapes visit
  nothing new, and the capture tape is bounded by the recorded output.
* `Turing.embedSilentRetTM_run`, `Turing.embedEmitRetTM_run` — the
  through-halt contracts: live lockstep, then the handover at the source's
  first halt, final emission and source residue preserved, with the return
  anchor reached first exactly there.
* `Turing.embedSilentRetTM_visitedByTapeHead`,
  `Turing.embedEmitRetTM_visitedByTapeHead` — the returning flavors visit
  exactly what the closed flavors visit, at every time.

/-- **R1 lockstep, suppressing flavor** (spec, fill pending — design §12;
[Bon26], `rename_executes`). The transported run *is* the transport of the
source run, at every time and with the step count preserved exactly: `t`
host steps simulate `t` source steps. No liveness guard is needed — the
transformer preserves states, so a halted source transports to a halted
host and both runs stall together.

**Proof sketch.** One-step commutation plus
`Turing.MultiTapeTM.runFrom_comm_of_step`. For the step: a halted source
makes both sides the identity. For a live source state, the host reads the
source symbols through `ι` (the transport puts source tape `i` at `ι i`),
so the host applies `embedActionCore` of the very action the source
applies; componentwise, selected tapes update as the source's
(`Turing.Action.apply` through the `embedSlot` inverse, whose two
equations `embedSlot ι (ι i) = some i` and `embedSlot ι j = none` off the
range are the `List.find?` glue obligations), unselected tapes receive the
stationary no-write action, the capture tape appends the optional emission
at head `|pre ++ c.output|` (`Turing.FinTM.bufferTape_append`, exactly as
in `capture_apply`), silence keeps the output at `out₀`, and the states
agree. -/

agrees on the nose.

**Proof sketch.** Both visited sets are images of `Finset.range (t + 1)`
under the respective head trajectories

`embedSilentTM_runFrom` makes the trajectories pointwise equal at `ι i`

starts one past `pre ++ c.output` and advances right exactly once per
recorded emission.

**Proof sketch.** By lockstep the capture head position at time `t'` is
`|pre| + |(M.runFrom c t').output|`, which is nondecreasing in `t'` with
increments bounded by one emission per step; the visited set is therefore
the integer interval from the initial head to the final one, of
cardinality the output growth plus one

sits at the **live return anchor** over the completed transport — the
halting transition's emission recorded on `cap`, the source tape residue
preserved on the selected bank, the frame untouched — having visited the
anchor first exactly there. The smallest case is the round-1 counterexample
cured: a one-state source that emits and halts on its first transition
lands at time `1` in `Sum.inr ()` with `pre ++ [b]` on the capture tape
(the audit's S8 check).

**Proof sketch.** Live times: the `Sum.inl` branch applies the very core of
`Turing.embedSilentTM`, so `embedSilentTM_runFrom`'s one-step commutation
transports verbatim under `Cfg.mapState Sum.inl` (`Cfg.mapState_apply`).
At the halting step, the source action's tape and capture effects are those
of the closed flavor — `Turing.FinTM.bufferTape_append` records the final
emission — while the successor `Option.elim` lands in `Sum.inr ()` instead
of `none`; the anchor cannot occur earlier because live source states map
into `Sum.inl`. Fill obligations, named: the two `Option.elim` successor

/-- **R1′ space, suppressing flavor** (spec, fill pending — round-1 repair
R1): at every time and on every tape, the returning embedding's visited set
from the `Sum.inl`-mapped seam equals the closed embedding's from the plain
seam — the trajectories coincide through the halt, and afterwards one idles
at the live anchor while the other sits halted, both stationary.

**Proof sketch.** For `t` up to the first source halt, both machines apply
identical tape actions (`embedSilentRetTM_run`'s lockstep and the halting
step's shared core); beyond it, the anchor's idle action and the halted
absorption are both stationary, freezing both visited sets. -/
