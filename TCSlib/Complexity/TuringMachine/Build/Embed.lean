# Machine-construction library: bank embedding (R1)

The general tape-embedding layer of the machine-construction library
(`machine-library-design.md` §12, R1): a verified routine on its own
`m`-tape set runs on any injectively selected subset of a `k`-tape host's
work tapes, cost unchanged, everything else framed. This is the §5
deferral promoted — the design deferred the general form "until a third
site needs it", and the third, fourth, and fifth sites have arrived (the
chapter-1/2 retrofit families, the Hennie–Stearns `k`→2 conversion, the
two-work-tape universal machine). It is the generic form of the private
`emitterBank*`/`emitterP2*` relocation families of
`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Build.Primitives`, of the 4A chain's
`clBank*`/`clSlot*` families, and of the retained-tape disciplines that
`Build/Loop.lean` and `Build/Wrappers.lean` carry internally.

**Status: statement skeleton (§12 statement phase).** The transformers and
configuration transports below are real definitions; every contract is
sorried, each with a proof sketch naming its fill obligations.

## Design

Per frozen decision 12.4 there are **two named transformers over one
shared private core** (`embedActionCore`), so each spec stays crisp and a
consumer cites whichever fits:

* `Turing.embedSilentTM` — the W1/capture flavor: the embedded routine's
  emissions are recorded on a designated host work tape `cap` outside the
  selected bank, and the host's physical output stays silent.
* `Turing.embedEmitTM` — the E2/forwarding flavor: emissions pass to the
  host's physical output verbatim.

Both transformers preserve the source state type and map the source halt
to the host halt; redirecting the halt into a live dispatch state is
deliberately **not** this module's job but the seam combinator's
(`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Build.Seam`), mirroring how
`Turing.capture_run`'s `ret` clause is consumed there. Lockstep is
therefore unguarded: it holds at every time, with the step count preserved
exactly. `Turing.captureAction`/`Turing.capture_run` and
`Turing.emitAction`/`Turing.emit_run` are the two fixed-shape precursors
(last-tape capture, identity selection); their statements are untouched.

## Main definitions

* `Turing.embedSilentCfg`, `Turing.embedEmitCfg` — a source configuration
  transported along `ι : Fin m ↪ Fin k`, with the unselected host tapes
  carried as frame parameters.
* `Turing.embedSilentTM`, `Turing.embedEmitTM` — the two machine
  transformers.

## Main results

All sorried (statement phase):

* `Turing.embedSilentTM_runFrom`, `Turing.embedEmitTM_runFrom` — lockstep:
  the transported run is the transport of the source run, same step count.
* `Turing.embedSilentTM_frame`, `Turing.embedEmitTM_frame` — tapes outside
  `Set.range ι` byte-identical with heads unmoved, input position tracking
  the source, output per flavor.
* `Turing.embedSilentTM_visitedByTapeHead`,
  `Turing.embedEmitTM_visitedByTapeHead` (and `_frame` companions),
  `Turing.embedSilentTM_spaceUsedByTape_cap` — per-tape space: host tape
  `ι i` visits exactly the source's tape-`i` cells, unselected tapes visit
  nothing new, and the capture tape is bounded by the recorded output.

`ι`, recording every emission on the designated host work tape `cap`
(intended outside `Set.range ι`) and emitting nothing physically — the

/-- **R1 lockstep, suppressing flavor** (spec, fill pending — design §12;
[Bon26], `rename_executes`). The transported run *is* the transport of the
source run, at every time and with the step count preserved exactly: `t`
host steps simulate `t` source steps. No liveness guard is needed — the
transformer preserves states, so a halted source transports to a halted
host and both runs stall together.

**Proof sketch.** One-step commutation plus
`Turing.MultiTapeTM.runFrom_comm_of_step`. For the step: a halted source
makes both sides the identity. For a live source state, the host reads the
source symbols through `ι` (the transport puts source tape `i` at `ι i`),
so the host applies `embedActionCore` of the very action the source
applies; componentwise, selected tapes update as the source's
(`Turing.Action.apply` through the `embedSlot` inverse, whose two
equations `embedSlot ι (ι i) = some i` and `embedSlot ι j = none` off the
range are the `List.find?` glue obligations), unselected tapes receive the
stationary no-write action, the capture tape appends the optional emission
at head `|pre ++ c.output|` (`Turing.FinTM.bufferTape_append`, exactly as
in `capture_apply`), silence keeps the output at `out₀`, and the states
agree. -/

Along the whole transported run, every host tape outside the selected bank
and distinct from the capture tape is byte-identical to its ambient frame
with its head unmoved; the input position tracks the source's; and the
host's physical output stays `out₀` (output silence).

**Proof sketch.** Project the lockstep equation
`embedSilentTM_runFrom` componentwise: the transport's `workTapes`/
`workTapePos` at an unselected `j ≠ cap` are the frame parameters by the
`embedSlot` off-range equation, its `inputPos` is the source's, and its
`output` is `out₀` by definition. -/

source tape `i`"). The visited set of host tape `ι i` up to time `t` is
exactly the source's visited set of tape `i`, so the per-tape space
agrees on the nose.

**Proof sketch.** Both visited sets are images of `Finset.range (t + 1)`
under the respective head trajectories
(`Turing.MultiTapeTM.visitedByTapeHead`), and the lockstep equation
`embedSilentTM_runFrom` makes the trajectories pointwise equal at `ι i`
via the transport's `workTapePos` clause and `embedSlot ι (ι i) = some i`.
The cardinality clause is `congrArg Finset.card`. -/

moves, so the trajectory image collapses to `{heads j}`; the cardinality
clause is `Finset.card_singleton`. -/

/-- **R1 space, suppressing flavor, the capture tape** (spec, fill

tape included). The capture tape's space usage up to time `t` is bounded
by the number of emissions recorded in that window plus one: the head
starts one past `pre ++ c.output` and advances right exactly once per
recorded emission.

**Proof sketch.** By lockstep the capture head position at time `t'` is
`|pre| + |(M.runFrom c t').output|`, which is nondecreasing in `t'` with
increments bounded by one emission per step; the visited set is therefore
the integer interval from the initial head to the final one, of
cardinality the output growth plus one

source's output at every instant (through the transport).

**Proof sketch.** As `embedSilentTM_runFrom`, with the capture clause
replaced by the output clause: the one-step commutation appends the
optional emission after `pre` (associativity of `++`, exactly as in
`emit_apply`), and `Turing.MultiTapeTM.runFrom_comm_of_step` iterates. -/
