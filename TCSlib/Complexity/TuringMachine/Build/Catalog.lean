# Machine-construction library: catalog promotions and space annotations (R3)

The R3 increment of the machine-construction library
(`machine-library-design.md` §12): the remaining audited A-chain tape
routines promoted as public machines with exact time **and** space costs,
plus the space retro-annotation of the existing catalog and control
surface. Per frozen decision 12.2 this lives in a **new** file — the new
rows and the space lemmas for the old rows both — keeping
`Build/Primitives.lean` byte-identical; the later refactor toward a
per-theme layout is a recorded backlog item.

**Status: statement skeleton (§12 statement phase).** The five routine
machines and their two phase alphabets are real definitions (TM1-style
labelled control, the catalog's house idiom); every contract is sorried,
each with a proof sketch naming its fill obligations.

## Part 1 — new promotions (seam routines)

Configuration-level routines at the `Turing.Cfg.ofWords` seam of
`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Build.Convention`, entering at their
start anchor with heads at the origin and exiting at a **live** anchor
(first-return cut included in each contract), so they compose under
`Turing.seamCompTM`. These are D6-style promotions of the audited 4A
privates — the A3 chain proved `3|w| + 3` copy and `2|w| + 2` clear,
matching the external prior art's catalog to within one step
(independent convergence, 2026-10-06 survey; [Bon26], the
transfer/clear/copy routine catalog):

* `Turing.transferTM` — move a word from tape `src` to tape `dst`
  (source erased), within `3|w| + 3`.
* `Turing.copyTM` — copy a word from tape `src` to tape `dst` (source
  kept), within `3|w| + 3`.
* `Turing.clearTM` — blank the word on one tape, within `2|w| + 2`.
* `Turing.compareTM` — word equality of two tapes, verdict in the exit
  anchor, tapes restored, within `2·min(|u|,|v|) + 2`.
* `Turing.incrementTM` — in-place little-endian fixed-width increment
  (`Turing.incFixed`), success/overflow in the exit anchor, within
  `2|w| + 2`; on overflow the word wraps to all-`false`.

Each routine carries per-tape space statements
(`Turing.MultiTapeTM.spaceUsedByTape`): the touched tapes visit at most
the word interval plus the two boundary blanks, and every other tape
stays at its origin singleton.

## Part 2 — space retro-annotation

Per frozen decision 12.3, the existing catalog rows (P1–P15 as realized)
and the control combinators W1–W3 and L receive `spaceUsed` theorems in
this increment, with no signature changes and no edits to the home files:
each annotation restates the audited row's existential contract joined
with a space clause on the same witness, so the audited statement surface
is untouched (additive growth). The emitter combinators (E1/E2/E3′/E4′ —
`exists_emitLoopTM`, `emit_run`/`exists_emitCallTM`, the stream rows
P16–P18, `splitSolveWith`) stay lazy until a space consumer appears.

## Main definitions

* `Turing.SweepPhase`, `Turing.FlagPhase` — the two phase alphabets.
* `Turing.transferTM`, `Turing.copyTM`, `Turing.clearTM`,
  `Turing.compareTM`, `Turing.incrementTM`.

## Main results

All sorried (statement phase): the five routines' run and per-tape space
contracts (`*_run`, `*_spaceUsedByTape`); the catalog space rows
`Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_*_spaceUsed` (P1–P15 as realized,
including the threaded-map row with its payload space hypothesis); and
the control-layer rows `Turing.capture_visitedByTapeHead` (W1),
`Turing.FinTM.redirectTM_spaceUsedByTape` (W2),
`Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_cond_spaceUsed` (W3), and
`Turing.FinTM.exists_loopTM_spaceUsed` (L).

visiting either exit anchor earlier — the seam carrying the overflow
verdict and the wrapped all-`false` word, the enumerator's counter

images and their cardinalities agree. The capture head sits at
`|pre ++ output-so-far|`, which is nondecreasing (one cell per recorded

/-- **L space row** (spec, fill pending — design §12 R3, decision 12.3;
annotates `Turing.FinTM.exists_loopTM`; the `exists_loopCfgTM` and
`exists_loopFindTM` siblings inherit the same host at fill time). Same
hypotheses as the decision loop, plus space bounds for the fuel machine
and for the body — from its initial configuration and from every
admissible seam, within the round budget. Conclusion: the loop host also
runs within a constant multiple of `S n + T n + 1` work-tape cells. The
key point is that space does **not** scale with the round count `R`:
rounds restart from seams with heads at the origin, so their footprints
overlap instead of accumulating.

**Proof sketch.** Per tape, each round's visited set is an interval
containing the seam origin (heads move by unit steps from the origin) of
cardinality at most `S n`, so the union over all rounds lies in
`[-(S n), S n]` — at most `2·S n + 1` cells, not `R·S n`. The counter
tape holds the fuel word, of length at most `T n`
(`Turing.MultiTapeTM.output_length_le` on the fuel machine), walked in
place by the debits; the capture tape records one verdict per round and
is rewound with the round, staying within a constant; the fuel machine's
own banks are bounded by `hFspace`. Sum the groups and absorb tape
counts into `c`. -/
