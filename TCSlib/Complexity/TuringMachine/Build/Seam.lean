# Machine-construction library: seam composition (R2)

The configuration-level sequencing layer of the machine-construction
library (`machine-library-design.md` §12, R2): sequential composition of
two controllers at the canonical `Turing.Cfg.ofWords` seam of
`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Build.Convention`. If `M₁` carries seam
`c₀` to seam `c₁` within `T₁` under a first-return cut, and `M₂` carries
`c₁` to `c₂` within `T₂`, the dispatch-glued composite carries `c₀` to
`c₂` within `T₁ + 1 + T₂` — the explicit constant is `1`, one silent
stationary dispatch step at the seam. This is the generic form of the
per-batch dispatch gluing re-proved in every A-chain and emitter batch,
and it exists at the configuration level precisely because the emitter
round-1 finding stands: *function-level* contracts cannot deliver
clean-return seams, so composing `ComputesFunInTime` contracts can never
replace this combinator.

**Status: statement skeleton (§12 statement phase).** The composite is a
real definition (state-sum dispatch in `Turing.bufferedCompTM`'s style,
kept minimal); every contract is sorried, each with a proof sketch naming
its fill obligations.

## Design

* The glue is a **state sum** `S₁ ⊕ S₂`: left states run `M₁`'s table,
  right states run `M₂`'s, and the designated left anchor `exit` takes one
  stationary, silent, write-free transition to the right anchor `entry`.
  Dispatch-on-anchor (rather than dispatch-on-halt) matches the ABI: seam
  contracts end at a **live** anchor (`Build/Loop.lean`'s `hstart`/
  `hround` shape), and the catalog routines of
  `TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Build.Catalog` exit at live anchors.
* The space clause is stated in the **sharp per-tape form** (frozen
  decision 12.1): the headline is per-tape containment of visited sets —
  the composite's visited set on every work tape is contained in the
  union of the phases' — which implies both the per-tape sum bound and
  the max bound for disjointly-owned tapes, stated as corollaries.

## Main definitions

* `Turing.seamCompTM` — the dispatch-glued composite of two machines at
  `Turing.Cfg.ofWords` seams.

## Main results

All sorried (statement phase):

* `Turing.seamCompTM_run` — seam-to-seam composition within
  `T₁ + 1 + T₂`.
* `Turing.seamCompTM_firstReturn` — the composite inherits a first-return
  cut at the final anchor, so composites chain.
* `Turing.seamCompTM_visitedByTapeHead` — per-tape visited-set
  containment (the headline space clause, decision 12.1).
* `Turing.seamCompTM_spaceUsedByTape_le_add`,
  `Turing.seamCompTM_spaceUsed_le_add`,
  `Turing.seamCompTM_spaceUsedByTape_le_max` — the sum and
  max-for-disjointly-owned-tapes corollaries.

/-- **R2, the seam composite** (design §12; [Bon26], `executes_in_sum`).
The dispatch-glued sequential composite of `M₁` and `M₂` at
`Turing.Cfg.ofWords` seams: states are the sum `S₁ ⊕ S₂`, left states run
`M₁`'s transition table and right states `M₂`'s (each halting where its
phase halts), except that the designated left anchor `exit` takes one
stationary, silent, write-free dispatch step to the right anchor `entry`.
The composite starts at `M₁`'s initial state; a run launched at a left
seam anchor is the intended use. -/

/-- **R2, seam-to-seam composition** (spec, fill pending — design §12;
[Bon26], `executes_in_sum`). If `M₁` carries the seam
`Cfg.ofWords start w₀` to the seam `Cfg.ofWords exit w₁` in exactly `T₁`
steps without visiting the anchor `exit` earlier (the first-return cut),
and `M₂` carries `Cfg.ofWords entry w₁` to `Cfg.ofWords q₂ w₂` in exactly
`T₂` steps, then the composite carries the left-mapped first seam to the
right-mapped last seam in exactly `T₁ + 1 + T₂` steps — the explicit
dispatch constant is `1`, not `O(1)`.

**Proof sketch.** Three segments composed with
`Turing.MultiTapeTM.runFrom_add`. (i) *Phase one lockstep*: on left
states other than the anchor, one composite step is the `Sum.inl`-mapped
`M₁` step; the cut guarantees the anchor is not visited before `T₁`, so
induction carries the left-mapped configuration to time `T₁`, where it is
`Cfg.ofWords (Sum.inl exit) w₁`. (ii) *Dispatch*: at the anchor the
composite takes the stationary silent step, and a stationary write-free
action fixes every tape, head, and the output of a seam configuration, so
time `T₁ + 1` is exactly `Cfg.ofWords (Sum.inr entry) w₁`. (iii) *Phase
two lockstep*: on right states one composite step is the
`Sum.inr`-mapped `M₂` step (`Turing.MultiTapeTM.runFrom_comm_of_step`),
carrying the seam to the right-mapped `Cfg.ofWords q₂ w₂` at time
`T₁ + 1 + T₂`. The degenerate case `T₁ = 0` (so `start = exit`,
`w₀ = w₁`) is covered because the dispatch step alone performs the
phase-one handover. -/

/-- **R2, the inherited first-return cut** (spec, fill pending — design
§12). Under the hypotheses of `seamCompTM_run`, if additionally `M₂` does
not visit its final anchor `q₂` strictly before `T₂`, then the composite
does not visit `Sum.inr q₂` strictly before `T₁ + 1 + T₂` — so a
composite is itself a seam-to-seam routine and chains under further
`seamCompTM` applications.

**Proof sketch.** Split the window. Before and at `T₁` the composite's
state is a left state (phase-one lockstep of `seamCompTM_run`), never
`Sum.inr q₂` by constructor disjointness. From `T₁ + 1` on, the
composite's state is the `Sum.inr` image of `M₂`'s state at the shifted
time (phase-two lockstep), and `Sum.inr` injectivity turns the `M₂` cut
into the composite cut; a mid-phase `M₂` halt is excluded because halting
absorbs and would contradict `h₂`'s live anchor at `T₂`. -/

  sorry

/-- **R2 space, the per-tape headline** (spec, fill pending — design §12,
frozen decision 12.1: the sharp per-tape form). On every work tape `i`,
the composite's visited set over the whole composed run is contained in
the union of the two phases' visited sets. This is the statement the sum
and max corollaries below both project from; it is deliberately the
containment itself, since downstream applications may depend on the
sharpness.

**Proof sketch.** Decompose the trajectory by the two lockstep segments
of `seamCompTM_run`: times `0, …, T₁` reproduce `M₁`'s head positions
(phase-one lockstep), time `T₁ + 1` is the dispatch step, which is
stationary — the head sits at the seam origin, already visited by both
phases' initial configurations — and times `T₁ + 1, …, T₁ + 1 + T₂`
reproduce `M₂`'s positions shifted by `T₁ + 1` (phase-two lockstep).
Every trajectory point therefore lies in one of the two phases' images;
conclude by `Finset.image` monotonicity over the split of
`Finset.range`. -/

/-- **R2 space, the max corollary for disjointly-owned tapes** (spec, fill
pending — design §12, frozen decision 12.1: the sharpest available form).
If one of the two phases is *idle* on tape `i` — its visited set is the
seam-origin singleton `{0}` — then the composite's space usage on `i` is
bounded by the **max** of the phases' usages, not their sum. Under a
tape-ownership discipline (each work tape owned by one phase, the other
phase never moving its head there) this gives per-tape space equal to the
owner's, which is what the chapter-4 consumers depend on.

**Proof sketch.** From `seamCompTM_visitedByTapeHead` the composite's
visited set is contained in the union, and the idle side's singleton
`{0}` is already contained in the other side's visited set — a seam
configuration has every head at the origin, so `0` is in every phase's
visited set at every horizon. The union collapses to the non-idle side's
set; `Finset.card_le_card` and `le_max_left/right` finish. -/
