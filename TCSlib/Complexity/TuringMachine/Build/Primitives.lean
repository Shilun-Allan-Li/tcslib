# Machine-construction library: the primitive catalog

The instruction set of the machine-construction library
(`machine-library-design.md` §4, P1–P12): the timed string functions every
Chapter-2 fill batch privately rebuilt, stated once as machine contracts.
`Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_id` and
`Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_const` (in
`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Composition`) are catalog entries P1–P2
and already proved; this module states the rest.

**Status: spec phase.** Every theorem below is sorried; roughly half are
harvests — their fills adapt already-proved private constructions from the
Chapter-2 epoch-2 batches (named per entry) — and the rest are new small
machines. Following the house idiom of
`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Composition`, the contracts are
existentially packaged; each fill implements a named private machine with
its run invariants and closes the existential. Multi-argument interfaces
go through `Turing.pairEncode`, whose self-delimiting grammar lets a
pipeline stage **thread the original input through its output** — the
`pairLenCheck` and `stripLast` contracts below are deliberately stated in
that threaded form, which is exactly how the Chapter-2 verifier
constructions consume them. New Chapter-1 surface, flagged for the shared
infrastructure audit round.

**Catalog refinements at spec time** (recorded against the frozen design
§4): P6 is realized as the fixed-first-component encoder plus the threaded
extractors/validity test; P7 (replicate) is subsumed by the unary clause of
P5, whose instances are what the emission customers actually consume; P8
is realized in threaded form (`pairLenCheck`); P12 (`clearTM`) has no
standalone string-function contract — clearing is intra-machine and lives
in the loop fill's toolkit. **Round-2 additions** (per round-1 finding 3:
the extractors discard the other component by design, and sequential
composition alone never yields simultaneous access to two results): P13
`pairConcat` (the D-WRAP shape), P14 `pairDup` (the entry stage of
data-retaining pipelines), and the threaded-map combinator `pairMapSnd`;
P10's narrowing is recorded, and result-bearing search is now
`Turing.FinTM.exists_loopFindTM` (`machine-library-design.md` §9b).

**Implementation note (batch P, partial).** The first eleven targets in the
batch brief's fill order are now proved. The four continuation targets are
`pairLenCheck`, `stripLast`, `pairMapSnd`, and `splitSolve`; their audited
statements and admissions remain unchanged. The original spec-phase prose
above and on the contracts is retained as the audit record. The length
counter is obtained from the public `Complexity.timeConstructible_id`, whose
proved machine implements precisely the sketched amortized counter. The three
extractors share one private buffered parser, so suffix-only extraction also
buffers and replays silently before copying the suffix; its linear envelope
is unchanged. The fixed-width incrementer adapts the enumerator's carry
semantics to two native-input scans, validating before physical emission.


**Implementation note (batch P2, partial).** The threaded length checker and
marker stripper are now proved; the threaded map and split search remain the
unchanged continuation frontier. The length checker composes the existing
buffered first extractor with the unary generator, captures the result with
`capture_run`, then reparses and counts down on the native payload. Malformed
inputs emit only `[false]`. The marker stripper first guards on a valid
extracted suffix containing a true bit; the successful branch buffers the
whole original encoding, erases its final marker/false-run, and replays the
retained encoding. The guard is complete before any physical output. Both
routes reuse the in-file parser/scan invariant patterns and proved public
wrappers. `catalogPayload_computes` supplies a proved relocated-simulation
component for the next target, with its time evaluated at the actual suffix
length; the retained-prefix/captured-output controller remains to be built.


**Implementation note (batch P3, partial).** The threaded map is now proved.
`pairMapTM` captures `catalogPayload_computes` on the original physical input,
rewinds the capture and input, validates without emission, then replays the
original encoded prefix and captured result. `pairMap_computes` bounds this
controller by `4 * (T n + n + 3)` and the public theorem uses coefficient 40.
All original contract docstrings are retained as the audit record.

The split-search theorem remains the unchanged admitted frontier. Its new
private, admission-free components are the unary orbit/search bridges and
`splitSolve_of_body`, which closes the public result only when supplied the
actual startup and round contracts; a candidate-preserving unary-bank
preparer; a counted source-simulation correspondence; the generator's exact
loop endpoint; and a scratch-restoration controller with a positive first
return and no earlier visit to its return state. These separate component
proofs do not yet constitute a combined body or a proof of its `hround`.
-/

/-! Batch P4 closure note: the split-search body is now constructed and proved.
`splitBodyTM` separates preparation, counted source evaluation, checked rewind,
rejection restoration, and native-bit emission into disjoint finite phases.
`splitBody_round` composes their exact seams and proves positive duration and
strict-interior anchor exclusion, including the arbitrary-bit past-end stall.
`splitEmit_run` supplies the native-slice payload; `splitBody_envelope` accounts
for every phase within the common polynomial bound. Both exponent cases
instantiate this body through the proved `splitSolve_of_body` loop closure.
All fifteen primitive contracts are now proved without admissions. Earlier
spec/checkpoint status notes above are retained as historical documentation. -/

addition per round-1 finding 3 — the data-retaining assembly the
extractors deliberately do not provide: sequential composition yields
`g (f z)` only, never simultaneous access to a retained component). Given
a machine for `g`, transform a pair's payload while carrying its head
component unchanged; malformed inputs yield `[]`. Monotonicity of `Tg`
converts the payload-length bound `|b| ≤ |z|` into a time bound, exactly
as in `Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_comp`.

**Construction sketch.** Parse `pairEncode a b` onto two work tapes,
silent until the separator validates; run the `g`-machine on `b`
relocated-and-captured (the W1 discipline — its output lands on the
capture tape, with length bounded by its running time via
`Turing.MultiTapeTM.output_length_le`); then emit the re-encoded pair:

the enlarged region does not authorize a witness. Malformed inputs answer
`false`.

**Construction sketch.** Parse the two components onto work tapes (the
extractor scans above); lay down `C·(|a|+1)^e` in unary by the
polynomial-evaluation loop; compare against `|b|` by a parallel countdown;
emit the single verdict bit. -/

/-- **P9, marker strip** (spec, fill pending — harvest: the semantic layer
is the Exercise-2.1 batch's proved `stripCertificate` family; the machine
is new). On `pairEncode a v`, strip `v` at its **last** `true`
(`Turing.splitAtLastTrue`) and re-emit the threaded pair with the stripped
witness; an all-`false` region or a malformed input yields `[]` (the
rejection the downstream guard reads).

**Construction sketch.** Parse `a` and `v` onto work tapes; locate the
last `true` of `v` by one reverse sweep; then — and only then — emit the
re-encoded pair (doubled `a`, separator, the prefix of `v` before that
marker). All-`false` regions and parse failures halt with nothing
emitted. -/

/-- Instantiate the completed controller with an exact unary-output source.
The source assumption is discharged below separately for zero and positive
exponents; startup and the full body round have already been constructed.
**Proof sketch.** Supply the exact zero-time startup and constructed round to
the existing loop closure. The common envelope bounds the actual phase times,
and the source's unary-output length identifies the checked acceptance test. -/

/-- **P10, padding split search** (spec, fill pending — new; the bounded
search both padding constructions perform, realizable as a
`Turing.FinTM.exists_loopFindTM` instance over the polynomial-evaluation
primitive — the decision loop returns only a Boolean and cannot carry the
split). Search for the unique `i ≤ |w|` with `i + C·(i+1)^e = |w|`
(`Turing.solveSplit`); on success emit the threaded split
`pairEncode (w.take i) (w.drop i)`, and on failure `[]` — rejection when
no length-equation solution exists is the audited obligation.

**Construction sketch** (round 2: an `exists_loopFindTM` instance — the
decision loop exposes only a Boolean and cannot carry the payload,
round-1 finding 3; the narrowing from the catalog's supplied-predicate
search to this fixed length-equation search is recorded in
`machine-library-design.md` §9b). Instance data: round state
`s = List.replicate i true`, the candidate in unary;
`Inv w s := s.length ≤ w.length + 1`;
`stepF w s := if s.length ≤ w.length then s ++ [true] else s` (stall past
the end keeps the invariant step-closed); `acceptF w s` holds iff
`s.length + C·(s.length + 1)^e = w.length`, evaluated by the polynomial
loop and a countdown compare;
`out w s := pairEncode (w.take s.length) (w.drop s.length)` — always
nonempty, so success is distinguishable from the `[]` exhaustion; fuel
`R n := n`, so the orbit is exactly the candidates `0, …, n` and
`List.range.find?` returns the least solution, which strict monotonicity
of `i ↦ i + C·(i+1)^e` makes unique — `Turing.solveSplit`'s own
semantics. -/

/-- **P11, fixed-width increment** (spec, fill pending — harvest: the
enumerator batch's `enumCarryTM`/`enumCarry_correct`, proved with cost at
most twice the width plus two). The little-endian fixed-width successor
(`Turing.incFixed`), with `[]` on overflow, is computable in linear time.
The in-place form of the same carry loop is the loop combinator's fuel
counter.

**Construction sketch.** Two passes: the first scan detects overflow (all
trues) — nothing may be emitted while that is unknown; on a live word the
second pass emits falses over the carry prefix, a true at the first false,
and the remainder verbatim. The harvest source's in-place variant costs at
most twice the width plus two. -/
