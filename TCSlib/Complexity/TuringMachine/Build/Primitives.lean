# Machine-construction library: the primitive catalog

The instruction set of the machine-construction library
(`machine-library-design.md` §4, P1–P12): the timed string functions every
Chapter-2 fill batch privately rebuilt, stated once as machine contracts.
`Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_id` and
`Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_const` (in
`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Composition`) are catalog entries P1–P2
and already proved; this module states the rest.

**Status: spec phase.** Every theorem below is sorried; roughly half are
harvests — their fills adapt already-proved private constructions from the
Chapter-2 epoch-2 batches (named per entry) — and the rest are new small
machines. Following the house idiom of
`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Composition`, the contracts are
existentially packaged; each fill implements a named private machine with
its run invariants and closes the existential. Multi-argument interfaces
go through `Turing.pairEncode`, whose self-delimiting grammar lets a
pipeline stage **thread the original input through its output** — the
`pairLenCheck` and `stripLast` contracts below are deliberately stated in
that threaded form, which is exactly how the Chapter-2 verifier
constructions consume them. New Chapter-1 surface, flagged for the shared
infrastructure audit round.

**Catalog refinements at spec time** (recorded against the frozen design
§4): P6 is realized as the fixed-first-component encoder plus the threaded
extractors/validity test; P7 (replicate) is subsumed by the unary clause of
P5, whose instances are what the emission customers actually consume; P8
is realized in threaded form (`pairLenCheck`); P12 (`clearTM`) has no
standalone string-function contract — clearing is intra-machine and lives
in the loop fill's toolkit.

/-- **P3, prepend a fixed word** (spec, fill pending — harvest: the HALT
batch's `prefixTM`/`prefixTM_computes`, whose promotion the batch formally
requested). Emitting the fixed word `w` and then copying the input is
computable in linear time; the constant may depend on `w`, which is fixed
before the machine.

**Construction sketch.** The fixed emission chain of
`Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_const` for `w`, then the one-state copy
scan of `Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_id`; the harvest source proves the
exact budget `|w| + |x| + 1`. -/
theorem computesFunInTime_prepend (w : List Bool) :
    ∃ (M : FinTM Bool) (c : ℕ),
      M.ComputesFunInTime (fun x => w ++ x) fun n => c * (n + 1) := by
  sorry

/-- **P4, input length in binary** (spec, fill pending — new; the unary
scan is a one-state sweep and the binary counter discipline is the
`Turing.incFixed` carry loop). The little-endian binary representation
`Nat.bits` of the input length is computable in linear time.

**Construction sketch.** One left-to-right input scan driving an in-place
binary counter on a work tape (the `Turing.incFixed` carry discipline, cost
amortized constant per input cell), then emit the counter word. -/
theorem computesFunInTime_lengthBits :
    ∃ (M : FinTM Bool) (c : ℕ),
      M.ComputesFunInTime (fun x => Nat.bits x.length) fun n => c * (n + 1) := by
  sorry

/-- **P5, polynomial evaluation, unary clause** (spec, fill pending —
harvest: the TMSAT batch's `polyUnaryTM`/`poly_unary_computes`, proved with
budget `(C + 5(e+1) + 4)·(n+1)^(e+1)`). The exact unary value of
`C·(n+1)^e` at the input length is computable within a constant multiple of
`(n+1)^(e+1)`. Its instances are also the exact-emission primitive the
reduction constructions consume (catalog entry P7, subsumed here).

**Construction sketch** (the harvest source's, verbatim shape): `e + 1`
nested unary loop tapes of side length `n + 1`, installed by one input
scan; the innermost loop emits `C` trues per box point; a recursive
invariant restores completed inner heads, with loop depth `r` costing at
most `(C + 1 + 5r)·(n+1)^r`. -/
theorem computesFunInTime_polyUnary (C e : ℕ) :
    ∃ (M : FinTM Bool) (c : ℕ),
      M.ComputesFunInTime
        (fun x => List.replicate (C * (x.length + 1) ^ e) true)
        fun n => c * (n + 1) ^ (e + 1) := by
  sorry

/-- **P5, polynomial evaluation, binary clause** (spec, fill pending —
harvest: the TMSAT batch's composition of the unary generator with the
binary length counter). The little-endian binary representation of
`C·(n+1)^e` at the input length is computable within a constant multiple
of `(n+1)^(e+1)`.

**Construction sketch.** The unary generator above composed with the
binary length counter of `computesFunInTime_lengthBits` through the public
buffered composition (`Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_comp`) — the harvest
source's exact route. -/
theorem computesFunInTime_polyBits (C e : ℕ) :
    ∃ (M : FinTM Bool) (c : ℕ),
      M.ComputesFunInTime (fun x => Nat.bits (C * (x.length + 1) ^ e))
        fun n => c * (n + 1) ^ (e + 1) := by
  sorry

/-- **P6, pairing with a fixed first component** (spec, fill pending —
harvest: the HALT batch's `fixedPair_computes`, proved with the exact
budget `2|α| + |x| + 3`; its promotion was formally requested). For a
fixed word `α`, the self-delimiting pairing `pairEncode α x` is computable
in linear time. This is the threading stage: downstream threaded contracts
receive `pairEncode a b` and act on `b` while carrying `a`.

**Construction sketch.** `pairEncode α x` is literally
`(α doubled) ++ [false, true] ++ x`, so this is the prepend primitive at
that fixed word; it is kept as its own contract because consumers cite the
pairing grammar, and the harvest source proves the exact budget
`2|α| + |x| + 3`. -/
theorem computesFunInTime_pairEncodeFixed (α : List Bool) :
    ∃ (M : FinTM Bool) (c : ℕ),
      M.ComputesFunInTime (fun x => pairEncode α x) fun n => c * (n + 1) := by
  sorry

/-- **P6, first-component extraction** (spec, fill pending — new; the
aligned two-bit scan of the `Turing.pairDecode` grammar as a machine). On
a well-formed pair the doubled prefix is undoubled and emitted; on a
malformed input the output is `[]`.

**Construction sketch.** Output is append-only, so the scan must not emit
before the parse succeeds: undouble aligned `00`/`11` blocks onto a work
tape until the aligned `01` separator, then replay the buffer to the
output; any misaligned block halts with nothing emitted. -/
theorem computesFunInTime_pairFst :
    ∃ (M : FinTM Bool) (c : ℕ),
      M.ComputesFunInTime (fun x => ((pairDecode x).map Prod.fst).getD [])
        fun n => c * (n + 1) := by
  sorry

/-- **P6, second-component extraction** (spec, fill pending — new; the
same aligned scan, emitting the suffix after the separator instead). On a
malformed input the output is `[]`. Iterating this extractor is how the
nested-quadruple parsers of the TMSAT constructions decompose.

**Construction sketch.** Scan aligned blocks without emitting until the
separator is found (validity of the prefix must be known before any suffix
bit may be emitted), then copy the suffix verbatim; a misaligned block
halts silently. -/
theorem computesFunInTime_pairSnd :
    ∃ (M : FinTM Bool) (c : ℕ),
      M.ComputesFunInTime (fun x => ((pairDecode x).map Prod.snd).getD [])
        fun n => c * (n + 1) := by
  sorry

/-- **P6, grammar validity** (spec, fill pending — new). The single-bit
test for membership in the `Turing.pairDecode` grammar, the guard stage
every parser pipeline rejects malformed inputs with.

**Construction sketch.** One aligned two-bit scan in finite control; emit
the single verdict bit at the separator or at the first misaligned block.
No buffering is needed — only one bit is ever emitted, at the end. -/
theorem computesFunInTime_pairValid :
    ∃ (M : FinTM Bool) (c : ℕ),
      M.ComputesFunInTime (fun x => [(pairDecode x).isSome])
        fun n => c * (n + 1) := by
  sorry

/-- **P8, threaded length-bound check** (spec, fill pending — new; the
original-bound re-check discipline of the Exercise-2.1 reverse verifier,
in threaded form). On `pairEncode a b`, decide `|b| ≤ C·(|a|+1)^e` — the
original input `a` travels with the payload precisely so that this bound
is checked against *it*, the audited rule being that merely fitting inside
the enlarged region does not authorize a witness. Malformed inputs answer
`false`.

**Construction sketch.** Parse the two components onto work tapes (the
extractor scans above); lay down `C·(|a|+1)^e` in unary by the
polynomial-evaluation loop; compare against `|b|` by a parallel countdown;
emit the single verdict bit. -/
theorem computesFunInTime_pairLenCheck (C e : ℕ) :
    ∃ (M : FinTM Bool) (c : ℕ),
      M.ComputesFunInTime
        (fun x => [match pairDecode x with
          | some (a, b) => decide (b.length ≤ C * (a.length + 1) ^ e)
          | none => false])
        fun n => c * (n + 1) ^ (e + 1) := by
  sorry

/-- **P9, marker strip** (spec, fill pending — harvest: the semantic layer
is the Exercise-2.1 batch's proved `stripCertificate` family; the machine
is new). On `pairEncode a v`, strip `v` at its **last** `true`
(`Turing.splitAtLastTrue`) and re-emit the threaded pair with the stripped
witness; an all-`false` region or a malformed input yields `[]` (the
rejection the downstream guard reads).

**Construction sketch.** Parse `a` and `v` onto work tapes; locate the
last `true` of `v` by one reverse sweep; then — and only then — emit the
re-encoded pair (doubled `a`, separator, the prefix of `v` before that
marker). All-`false` regions and parse failures halt with nothing
emitted. -/
theorem computesFunInTime_stripLast :
    ∃ (M : FinTM Bool) (c : ℕ),
      M.ComputesFunInTime
        (fun x => match pairDecode x with
          | some (a, v) =>
            match splitAtLastTrue v with
            | some u => pairEncode a u
            | none => []
          | none => [])
        fun n => c * (n + 1) ^ 2 := by
  sorry

/-- **P10, padding split search** (spec, fill pending — new; the bounded
search both padding constructions perform, realizable as a
`Turing.FinTM.exists_loopTM` instance over the polynomial-evaluation
primitive). Search for the unique `i ≤ |w|` with `i + C·(i+1)^e = |w|`
(`Turing.solveSplit`); on success emit the threaded split
`pairEncode (w.take i) (w.drop i)`, and on failure `[]` — rejection when
no length-equation solution exists is the audited obligation.

**Construction sketch.** A `Turing.FinTM.exists_loopTM` instance: round
state is the candidate `i` in binary; each round evaluates
`i + C·(i+1)^e` in unary and compares it to `|w|` by countdown; a hit
emits the split (doubled prefix, separator, suffix) and a fuel exhaustion
at `i = |w|` halts silently. Strict monotonicity makes the hit unique. -/
theorem computesFunInTime_splitSolve (C e : ℕ) :
    ∃ (M : FinTM Bool) (c : ℕ),
      M.ComputesFunInTime
        (fun w => match solveSplit C e w.length with
          | some i => pairEncode (w.take i) (w.drop i)
          | none => [])
        fun n => c * (n + 1) ^ (e + 2) := by
  sorry

/-- **P11, fixed-width increment** (spec, fill pending — harvest: the
enumerator batch's `enumCarryTM`/`enumCarry_correct`, proved with cost at
most twice the width plus two). The little-endian fixed-width successor
(`Turing.incFixed`), with `[]` on overflow, is computable in linear time.
The in-place form of the same carry loop is the loop combinator's fuel
counter.

**Construction sketch.** Two passes: the first scan detects overflow (all
trues) — nothing may be emitted while that is unknown; on a live word the
second pass emits falses over the carry prefix, a true at the first false,
and the remainder verbatim. The harvest source's in-place variant costs at
most twice the width plus two. -/
theorem computesFunInTime_incFixed :
    ∃ (M : FinTM Bool) (c : ℕ),
      M.ComputesFunInTime (fun x => (incFixed x).getD []) fun n => c * (n + 1) := by
  sorry
