# Machine-construction library: the bounded loop

The control centerpiece of the machine-construction library
(`machine-library-design.md` §5, L; loop redesign §9b, configuration
export §9c): a bounded loop with tape-resident round state, specified at
four granularities.

* `Turing.loop_run` is the **summation lemma**: given a family of round
  configurations with an accept-or-advance contract, the run from round 0
  halts within the summed budget with the loop's single verdict bit. It is
  the generic form of the Chapter-2 enumerator's proved private
  `enumLoop_run`, whose proof is the harvest template. (Round-1 audit:
  Pass.)
* `Turing.FinTM.exists_loopCfgTM` is the **configuration-level
  combinator** (added per round-2 finding 1): its conclusion exposes the
  host machine's round-configuration family, bounded startup, per-round
  accept-or-advance segments, and halted exhaustion terminal — the shape
  the frozen Chapter-2 `enumMachine_contracts` consumes, which the
  final-answer conclusion below provably cannot supply (the round-2 audit
  exhibits a final-answer-correct machine violating every per-round
  bound).
* `Turing.FinTM.exists_loopTM` is the **decision form**: one finite
  machine answers the Boolean "some orbit point accepts". At fill time it
  is a corollary of the configuration form through an
  already-halted-terminal summation lemma (the shape of the enumerator's
  `enumLoop_run`; the frozen `Turing.loop_run` requires an empty-output
  terminal, which the exported family's `[false]` terminal deliberately
  is not — round-3 finding R3-1), with startup absorbed by monotonicity.
* `Turing.FinTM.exists_loopFindTM` is the **result-bearing form**: the
  accepting round delivers a payload, and the machine outputs the first
  accepting orbit point's payload (`[]` on exhaustion) — the form the
  split search (catalog P10) and the reduction emitters instantiate.

**Status: spec phase, round-2 repair.** The round-1 audit
(`audits/ch1-infra-findings.md`) refuted the previous combinator: finding
1 (blocker) exhibited a zero-step "advance" (`stepF = id`, `t = 0`) that
made the hypotheses vacuously satisfiable and the conclusion contradict
the input-head information bound; finding 2 (major) showed the round
hypothesis quantified over *all* state words at the budget `T |x|`, which
no body can satisfy for width-growing rounds and which excludes the
intended customers. This revision repairs both:

* every round takes **positive time** (`0 < t`), and
* rounds are required only on **admissible** state words, via an
  input-indexed invariant `Inv x s` that the startup word satisfies
  (`hInv0`) and the advance step preserves (`hInvStep`); customers choose
  `Inv` to pin the state-word width to the input (instantiation tables in
  `machine-library-design.md` §9b).

`stepF`, `acceptF`, and the payload take the input as an explicit first
argument (finding 2's repair guidance): the enumerator's acceptance runs
the verifier on `x ++ s`.

## The round discipline

Round state is one word on the body's tape 0; every other body tape is
scratch, blank at both seam ends of a round (body-restores-scratch, frozen
design decision 9.2). A round either **accepts** — halts with its declared
output, nothing emitted earlier — or **advances** to the seam carrying the
stepped state word, in positive time, and in both cases without re-entering
the anchor state strictly between the seam and that endpoint (the host
detects round boundaries as entries into the embedded anchor; the clause is
load-bearing, round-1 attestation 7 and finding 1).

**Countdown discipline** (corrected per round-1 finding 4): the counter is
loaded from the fuel machine's output `Nat.bits (R |x|)`; the **initial
anchor entry is free**, and debiting starts with the second entry, so the
rounds completed before borrow-overflow are exactly `0, …, R |x|` — at
`R |x| = 0` (`Nat.bits 0 = []`) the single orbit point `s0 x` is still
checked before the empty counter overflows. Decrement cost is amortized
(the borrow lengths over a full countdown telescope to `O(R)`, and the
counter width is at most `T |x|` by `Turing.MultiTapeTM.output_length_le`
on the fuel machine), which is what keeps the stated budget at
`(T + 1) · (R + 2)` with no logarithmic factor — the round-1 audit
validated this budget strategy (finding 4, second half).

Given round configurations `cfg 0, …, cfg N` of one machine with empty
outputs, such that each round `j < N` within budget `B` either halts with
the verdict `[true]` (when `accept j`) or reaches `cfg (j+1)`, and the
exhaustion round `cfg N` halts with `[false]` within `B`: the run from
`cfg 0` halts within `(N + 1) · B` steps with the single verdict bit
`(List.range N).any accept`.

**Proof sketch.** Induction on the first accepting round (or `N` when none
accepts), composing the advance segments with
`Turing.MultiTapeTM.runFrom_add` and absorbing halted tails with
`Turing.MultiTapeTM.runFrom_of_halt`; empty round outputs make the final
output exactly the one emitted verdict. -/

/-- **The configuration-level loop combinator** (spec, fill pending;
added per round-2 finding 1 — the final-answer conclusion below cannot
discharge a configuration contract: the round-2 audit exhibits a machine
that answers correctly after a deliberate exponential delay, satisfying
the final-answer form while violating every per-round bound). Same
hypotheses as `exists_loopTM`; the conclusion instead exposes, for every
input, the host's **round-configuration family**: a bounded startup
reaching `cfg 0`, empty output at every round configuration, a per-round
accept-or-advance segment within a uniform constant multiple of
`T |x| + 1` — acceptance halting with `[true]`, advance reaching
`cfg (i + 1)` — and the halted `[false]` exhaustion terminal at index
`R |x| + 1`. This is the generic shape of the frozen Chapter-2
`enumMachine_contracts` (`machine-library-design.md` §9c gives the index
and budget translation). The decision form below is a corollary through
an already-halted-terminal summation lemma; the find form shares the
host construction with the payload surfaced, and is not claimed as a
`Turing.loop_run` corollary (round-3 finding R3-1).

**Proof sketch.** The intended host of `exists_loopTM` already *has* this
family: `cfg i` is the host image of the body's seam at the `i`-th orbit
point together with the counter state after `i` debits (initial entry
free), and `cfg (R |x| + 1)` is the halted configuration after the borrow
underflow and the `[false]` emission. Startup is the fuel phase plus the
body startup; each segment is one captured body round plus counter work
bounded **worst-case** by the counter width: the fuel word has length at
most `T |x|` (`Turing.MultiTapeTM.output_length_le` on the fuel machine)
and never grows, so every debit, rewind, and the final
underflow-plus-`[false]`-emission each cost a constant multiple of
`T |x| + 1` — the per-segment bound needs no amortization (round-3
finding R3-2; the amortized aggregate remains true but is not read off
per segment). -/

/-- **The decision loop combinator** (spec, fill pending; repaired per
round-1 findings 1, 2, and 4 — see the module docstring). Hypotheses:

* `hF`: the fuel machine writes `Nat.bits (R |x|)` within `T |x|`.
* `hInv0`, `hInvStep`: the admissibility invariant holds at the initial
  state word and is preserved by the step, so every orbit point the
  conclusion mentions is admissible.
* `hstart`: the body reaches the initial seam within `T |x|` without
  visiting the anchor state earlier.
* `hround`: on every **admissible** state word, the body takes **positive**
  time `t ≤ T |x|`, does not re-enter the anchor strictly before `t`, and
  either halts with the verdict `[true]` (acceptance) or sits at the seam
  carrying the stepped word (advance).

Conclusion: one finite machine answers, within a constant multiple of
`(T |x| + 1) · (R |x| + 2)`, whether some orbit point
`(stepF x)^[i] (s0 x)` with `i ≤ R |x|` is accepted.

At fill time this is a corollary of `exists_loopCfgTM` through an
already-halted-terminal summation lemma — the frozen `Turing.loop_run`
additionally requires an empty-output terminal, which the exported
`[false]` terminal is not (round-3 finding R3-1) — with startup absorbed
by `ComputesInTime.mono`.

**Proof sketch.** The combinator machine runs the fuel machine
relocated-and-captured to lay `Nat.bits (R |x|)` on a counter tape,
rewinds, and embeds the body via the W1 capture discipline of
`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Build.Wrappers` (the body's verdict is
captured, never physically emitted until the end). The initial anchor
entry is free; each subsequent entry debits the binary counter in place —
amortized borrow, exhaustion exactly at borrow-overflow, so rounds
`0, …, R |x|` run before the exhaustion rejection `[false]`. Acceptance
surfaces as the captured halt and emits `[true]`. `Turing.loop_run` sums
the seam family; the invariant hypotheses confine every round to
admissible words, and positive round duration makes each anchor entry a
genuine round boundary. Phase overheads are absorbed into `c`. -/

/-- **The result-bearing loop combinator** (spec, fill pending; added per
round-1 finding 3 — the decision form exposes only a Boolean, which cannot
express the split search's or the reduction emitters' outputs). Identical
skeleton to `exists_loopTM`, except the accepting round halts with the
declared payload `out x s`, and the machine outputs the **first** accepting
orbit point's payload — `[]` on fuel exhaustion, the library's threaded
rejection value. `List.range.find?` returns the least accepting index, which
is exactly the round at which the iterated body first halts.

**Proof sketch.** As `exists_loopTM`, with one change at the surface: on
the captured halt the host replays the entire capture tape (the payload)
as its output instead of the fixed verdict — the W1 core captures the
full output word precisely so that this variant costs nothing extra. A
payload may be `[]`; the conclusion's function is well-defined regardless,
and consumers that need to distinguish success from exhaustion use
nonempty payloads (the split search's `pairEncode` outputs are always
nonempty). -/
