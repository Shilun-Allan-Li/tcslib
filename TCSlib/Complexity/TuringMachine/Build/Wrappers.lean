# Machine-construction library: wrappers

The output-isolation layer of the machine-construction library
(`machine-library-design.md` §5, W1–W3): the capture/silence discipline
written once, consolidating its four private incarnations
(`universalCaptureTM` in the universal-machine development, the Chapter-2
enumerator's `enumCaptureTM`, the HALT batch's `acceptTM`, and the private
engine inside `TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Composition.exists_cond`).
The obligation list is the one the phase-1 and phase-4 audits tabulated:
every source emission is captured, **including an emission on the halting
transition**; the wrapper's physical output stays untouched; the completed
source configuration is preserved at the return.

**Status: spec phase.** The two action/configuration transformers and the
derived machine are real definitions; the four contract theorems are
sorried, to be filled from the existing private proofs (harvest) in the
library fill batches. New Chapter-1 surface, flagged for the shared
infrastructure audit round.

## Design

* **W1 (capture)** is *host-parametric*: rather than a closed wrapper
  machine, `Turing.captureAction` transforms one source action into a host
  action (source tapes untouched, emission appended to the last tape,
  silence, halt redirected to a designated return state), and
  `Turing.capture_run` says that **any** host machine agreeing with the
  transformed table on an embedded copy of the source states simulates the
  source in lockstep with its output captured on the last tape. Consumers
  (the loop fill, HALT-style control modifications, the Chapter-2
  continuations) embed the source into *their* controller state type and
  inherit the whole induction. The capture tape holds the full output
  word (tape-capture core, frozen design decision 9.3); reading one bit
  off it is the register corollary, derived at fill time.
* **W2 (halt-redirect)** is the `acceptTM` pattern as a closed
  transformation `Turing.FinTM.redirectTM`: simulate a machine silently
  while remembering the last emitted bit, halt exactly when the source
  halts with the designated bit, and otherwise enter a one-state
  stationary live loop.
* **W3 (timed branch)** is the quantitative form of
  `Turing.FinTM.exists_comp_partial`'s sibling
  `Turing.FinTM.exists_cond`: deciding which branch runs costs the
  decider's budget, and the branch runs on the *same* physical input, so
  no monotonicity hypothesis is needed.

## Main declarations

* `Turing.captureAction`, `Turing.captureCfg` — the W1 transformers.
* `Turing.capture_run` — the W1 lockstep/capture/silence contract (sorried).
* `Turing.FinTM.redirectTM` — the W2 transformation.
* `Turing.FinTM.redirectTM_computes`, `Turing.FinTM.redirectTM_live` — the
  W2 contract pair (sorried).
* `Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_cond` — the W3 timed branch (sorried).

## References

* [AB09] S. Arora, B. Barak, *Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach*,
  Cambridge University Press, 2009. (§1.2; the capture discipline is the
  output-isolation folklore every simulation argument of §1.4–§1.7 uses.)

**Implementation note (batch W).** All four contracts are now proved; the
original spec-phase descriptions above and in their docstrings are retained.
The conditional controller instantiates `capture_run` on a padded decider,
reads its singleton output, and uses a quantitative refinement of
`rewind_from_any`. Its branch-start prefix is at most twice the decider's
budget plus five, yielding the uniform multiplier `5` in the frozen bound.

**Maintainer note (D6 promotion).** Batch W's two shared-lemma promotion
requests are executed: `timed_input_bound` is now the public
`Turing.MultiTapeTM.timed_input_bound` in `Deterministic.lean` (generalized
from `Bool` to an arbitrary symbol type; the proof was symbol-free), and
`timed_rewind` is the public `Turing.FinTM.timed_rewind` in
`Simulation.lean`, verbatim. The private copies formerly here are removed;
the two call sites below consume the public lemmas.

variable {k : ℕ} {S H : Type*}

/-- W1 action transformer. Transform one source action into a host action
over one extra tape: the source's input move and work-tape actions are kept
on the first `k` tapes; the source's emission, **if any**, is written on
the last tape with a right move (so the capture tape accumulates the output
word from the origin); the host emits nothing; a live source successor is
embedded via `emb`, and a halting source action transfers control to the
designated return state `ret` — on the very transition that may carry the
final emission, which is therefore captured like any other. -/
def captureAction (emb : S → H) (ret : H) (a : Action k Bool S) :
    Action (k + 1) Bool H where
  inputTape := a.inputTape
  workTapes := fun i =>
    if h : (i : ℕ) < k then a.workTapes ⟨i, h⟩
    else
      match a.output with
      | some b => (some (some b), SignType.pos)
      | none => (none, SignType.zero)
  output := none
  state := some ((a.state.map emb).getD ret)

/-- W1 configuration correspondence. A source configuration `c`, viewed
inside a host with one extra tape: source state embedded (a halted source
sits at the return state `ret`), same input head, source work tapes on the
first `k` tapes, and the capture tape holding `pre ++ c.output` — the
emissions captured so far after a pre-existing prefix — with its head one
past that word. The host's own physical output is the untouched `out₀`. -/
def captureCfg {input : List Bool} (emb : S → H) (ret : H)
    (pre out₀ : List Bool) (c : Cfg k Bool S input) :
    Cfg (k + 1) Bool H input where
  state := some ((c.state.map emb).getD ret)
  inputPos := c.inputPos
  workTapes := fun i =>
    if h : (i : ℕ) < k then c.workTapes ⟨i, h⟩
    else FinTM.bufferTape (pre ++ c.output)
  workTapePos := fun i =>
    if h : (i : ℕ) < k then c.workTapePos ⟨i, h⟩
    else ((pre ++ c.output).length : ℤ)
  output := out₀

/-- Applying a captured action preserves the source fields and appends its
optional emission to the buffer. The write uses the old head before moving.
**Proof sketch.** Split the tape index at the source tape count. Source tapes
are unchanged by the embedding; on the final tape use `bufferTape_append`
for an emission and the stationary no-write action otherwise. -/

/-- **W1, the capture contract** (spec, fill pending — harvested from the
four private incarnations). If a host machine's transition table agrees, on
an embedded copy of the source's states, with the capture-transformed
source table, then the host run from a capture configuration *is* the
capture image of the source run, for as long as the source has not halted
before the time in question. Taking `t` to be the source's halting time
instantiates the return clause: the host sits at `ret` with the completed
source configuration preserved, the full source output (halting emission
included) on the capture tape, and the host output still `out₀`; taking
`t` below it gives live lockstep.

**Proof sketch.** Induction on `t`. One host step from a live capture image
applies the transformed action: the first `k` tapes and the input head
update exactly as the source's (`Turing.Action.apply` componentwise); the
capture tape appends the emitted bit, which is
`Turing.FinTM.bufferTape_append` at head `|pre ++ c.output|`; silence keeps
the host output at `out₀`; and the successor state is the embedded source
successor, or `ret` on the halting transition. -/

/-- **W3, the timed branch** (spec, fill pending): the quantitative form of
`Turing.FinTM.exists_cond`. If a decider machine computes the test bit
within `T₀` and each branch computes its function within `T₁`, `T₂`, the
conditional function is computable within a constant multiple of
`T₀ + max T₁ T₂ + 1`. No monotonicity hypothesis: the selected branch runs
on the *same* physical input.

**Proof sketch.** Run the decider through the W1 capture discipline (its
verdict on the capture tape, physical output silent), rewind per the
`Turing.FinTM.rewind_from_any` scan, then dispatch on the captured bit into
the two-machine branch union (`Turing.FinTM.branchTM`), which runs the
selected branch from its genuine initial configuration on the shared input.
Constant overhead per phase is absorbed into `c`. -/
