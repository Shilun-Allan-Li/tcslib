# Composition of Turing machine computations

Basic computability combinators for the bundled machines: the identity and constant
functions are linear-time computable, and time-bounded computability is closed under
composition. Composition is the load-bearing lemma of the whole development — the
universal machine (phase 3) and the `HALT` reduction (phase 4) are built from it — and
it is the part [AB09] never spells out, dispatching it with "high-level descriptions"
of machines. The Isabelle AFP `Cook_Levin` entry spends a large fraction of its effort
exactly here.

## Design

Composition is stated at the *specification* level (`ComputesFunInTime`), not as an
operator on raw machines: the composed machine is existentially produced. Internally
(proof obligation, not API) the construction simulates `M₁` with its emissions
redirected to a fresh work tape, then simulates `M₂` reading that tape in place of its
input tape.

**Convention obligation status** (phase-1 audit finding 4; phase-2 audit finding 3):
this file does *not* formally discharge the append-only vs read-write output-tape
bridge. Every statement here — hypotheses and conclusions alike — lives in the
append-only model, and [AB09]'s read-write-output machine is not formalized in this
development, so no simulation between the two conventions can even be stated yet. The
obligation is recorded in the plan's decision log as **waived**, with the compensating
restriction that no exact-step-count transfer from [AB09] is ever claimed: every bound
*adapted from the source* carries an existential constant (purely internal results,
such as the oracle lockstep lemmas, are legitimately exact but never cross a
convention), and every result is self-contained in-model. A formal bridge (a
read-write-output machine variant plus a simulation theorem) will be added if and only
if a downstream result needs it. What this file *does* provide is the buffer-and-flush
technique — an emission can be deferred to a work tape and flushed at the end — which
is what delayed or revisable output looks like *within this model*; whether the
append-only convention matches [AB09]'s read-write one remains formally unestablished,
per the waiver.

The generic simulation gadgets this file's machines are assembled from — emission
chains, control actions, disjoint tape-block embeddings with their lockstep run
lemmas, the input-head rewind, and the two-machine branch union — live in
`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Simulation` (split out at the epoch-1/epoch-2
boundary, per the epoch-1 audit findings 5 and 11 and the policy file-size
standard); this file keeps only its concrete machines and their theorems.

## Main results

* Time-bounded combinators (all over the binary alphabet):
  `Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_id`, `Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_const`,
  `Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_ifEq`, `Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_comp`.
* **Partial (guarded) combinators** — the phase-4 API mandated by the phase-3 audit
  (round 2, finding 10 and Argument F: the total-function composition cannot take
  the partially computing universal evaluator as a component):
  `Turing.FinTM.exists_comp_partial` composes two arbitrary machines at the level of
  their halting relations, with the intermediate output buffered on a work tape;
  `Turing.FinTM.exists_cond` branches between two machines on a decided predicate.
  Both are stated untimed; time-bounded refinements are deliberately deferred until
  a result needs them.

/-- Testing equality with a fixed string is computable in linear time: for any fixed
`w₀ u v`, the function `w ↦ u` if `w = w₀` and `w ↦ v` otherwise. (Instantiated by
the `HALT` reduction as the postprocessor `w ↦ if w = [true] then [false] else
[true]`; see `TCSlib.Complexity.Uncomputability.Halting`.)

**Proof sketch.** Hardcode `w₀`, `u`, and `v` in the states. The machine walks the
input left to right comparing it against `w₀` symbol by symbol (`|w₀| + 1`
comparison states); on the first mismatch — including the input ending early (blank
read) or running long (a symbol where `w₀` is exhausted) — it switches to an
emission chain for `v`, and after matching all of `w₀` and then reading the boundary
blank it switches to an emission chain for `u` (at most `|u| + |v| + 2` further
states, one emitted symbol per step). Every run halts within
`|w₀| + max |u| |v| + 3` steps — a constant, absorbed as `c * (n + 1)`. -/

/-- **Composition.** If `f` is computable within `T₁` and `g` within a monotone `T₂`,
then `g ∘ f` is computable within `c · (T₁ n + T₂ (T₁ n) + 1)`.

The inner bound `T₂ (T₁ n)` is valid because the intermediate string is no longer than
the time that produced it: `|f x| ≤ T₁ |x|` by `Turing.MultiTapeTM.output_length_le`.
Monotonicity of `T₂` is genuinely needed to convert that length bound into a time
bound.

**Proof sketch.** Build `M` with `M₁.k + M₂.k + 1` work tapes over `Bool`. Phase one
simulates `M₁` step for step on the true input, with `M₁`'s emissions written instead
onto the dedicated intermediate tape (constant overhead per step; this is the
append-only-output buffering discussed in the module docstring). Phase two rewinds the
intermediate tape head (at most `T₁ n` steps) and simulates `M₂` step for step, with
`M₂`'s input-head reads served from the intermediate tape and `M₂`'s emissions going to
the real output tape. Phase two costs constant overhead per step of `M₂`, which halts
within `T₂ |f x| ≤ T₂ (T₁ n)` steps. Bookkeeping (phase switching, boundary detection
on the intermediate tape) is absorbed into `c`. -/

/-- **Partial (guarded) sequential composition** — the phase-4 API obligation
identified by the phase-3 audit (round 2, finding 10 and Argument F):
`Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_comp` requires both components to compute *total*
functions, so it cannot take a partially computing machine — such as the universal
evaluator — as a component. This lemma composes two arbitrary machines at the level
of their halting relations, with **no totality or time hypotheses**: `M` behaves on
`x` exactly as `M₂` behaves on `M₁`'s completed output — halting, completed outputs,
and divergence all correspond.

Statement notes. The intermediate string `y` is existentially quantified, but by
`Turing.FinTM.ComputesInTime.output_unique` at most one `y` satisfies the first
conjunct, so the right-hand side reads "`M₁` halts on `x` (necessarily with a unique
`y`), and then `M₂` halts on `y` with `w`". If `M₁` diverges on `x`, or halts but
`M₂` diverges on its output, both sides are empty — `M` diverges. A time-bounded
refinement is deliberately not stated; it will be added if and when a result needs
it.

**Proof sketch** (buffered intermediate output, per the audit's design). `M` carries
`M₁`'s and `M₂`'s work tapes plus a fresh *buffer* tape. Phase one simulates `M₁` on
the true input step for step, with each emission of `M₁` written to the buffer tape
(write, move right) instead of the output tape; the append-only output discipline
makes the buffer region a verbatim copy of `M₁`'s output, contiguous from the
initial head cell. If `M₁` never halts, neither does `M`. On `M₁`'s halting
transition, `M` rewinds the buffer head to the leftmost written cell — the head
rests on the blank immediately *right* of the written word, so the rewind's first
left move is unconditional (testing the current cell before moving would stop at the
wrong end; phase-4 audit, finding 3), then left while reading a symbol, then one
step right. Phase two simulates `M₂` with its *input-tape
reads served from the buffer*: the buffer holds exactly `y` with blank cells on both
sides, and `M` maintains `M₂`'s virtual input position on it, mirroring the clamped
input-head semantics of `Turing.moveInputPos` at both boundaries — the same
virtual-boundary emulation as the universal machine's sketch
(`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Universal`); a blank read identifies a boundary,
and *which* boundary is determined by the direction of arrival, tracked in the
state — for an empty intermediate word the simulation starts with the right-boundary
tag already set, the left boundary one inward move away (phase-4 audit, finding 3).
`M₂`'s work-tape actions go to its own fresh tapes and its emissions to the
real output tape, untouched during phase one. `M` halts exactly when the simulated
`M₂` halts; step-for-step run correspondence in each phase gives both directions of
the iff. -/

**Proof sketch.** Choose the first halting time of `D` and use controller lockstep.
Output uniqueness identifies its completed output with `[b]`, so the register is
`some b`, including when that bit was emitted early. Rewind from the resulting

/-- **Branching on a decided predicate** — the second phase-4 combinator (phase-3
audit, round 2, Argument F, step 2 of the `HALT → UC` reduction): given a total
decider `D` for `p` and two branch machines, some machine behaves on every input
exactly as the branch selected by `p` does *on that same input*. The input tape is
read-only, so both branches see the original input.

**Proof sketch.** `D` computes the singleton output `[p x]` on every input, and
output is append-only, so along any run `D` emits exactly one symbol; simulate `D`
with that single emission recorded in a state register instead of emitted (no buffer
tape needed). On `D`'s halting transition, rewind the true input head to its initial
position: one step left, then left while reading a symbol, then one step right —
from any position this ends at input position `1`, the initial position, the clamp
at position `0` making the walk safe (including on empty input). Then transfer
control to a disjoint copy of `M₁` or `M₂` according to the register. The branches'
work tapes are fresh tapes `D` never touched, the output tape is untouched by phase
one, and the input head is back at its initial position, so the selected branch's
run is reproduced verbatim; determinism (`Turing.FinTM.ComputesInTime.output_unique`)
identifies `D`'s completed output with `[p x]`, so the selected branch is
`cond (p x) M₁ M₂`.

The implementation retains the first emission, with the exact invariant that the
register is the head of the simulated output. A live administrative state follows
the simulated halt before the first left move. For the forward implication, extend
any completed composite run beyond the verified branch-start prefix using absorbing
halting, then apply branch lockstep; the reverse implication concatenates that
prefix with the selected branch run. -/
