# Bidirectional versus unidirectional tapes

[AB09, Claim 1.8]: tapes that are infinite in both directions are simulated by tapes
infinite in one direction only, with constant-factor slowdown.

## Deviations from [AB09]

Our vendored model's tapes are *already* bidirectional (`ℤ`-indexed) — that choice is
what lets initialization dispense with start markers. So the faithful in-model
rendering of Claim 1.8 runs in the only meaningful direction: every machine is
simulated, with constant-factor slowdown and the same number of work tapes, by one
whose work heads **never visit a negative cell** (`Turing.FinTM.NonnegativeHeads`),
i.e. by a machine that uses its tapes unidirectionally. The simulating machine "folds"
each tape at the origin, following [AB09]'s proof, over the enlarged non-blank
alphabet `Bool × Option Γ × Option Γ` — an origin flag plus two *independent*,
possibly blank, payloads. (A bare `Γ × Γ` cannot represent a symbol paired with a
blank neighbor; phase-2 re-audit, finding 1.)

## Main results

* `Turing.FinTM.NonnegativeHeads` — the unidirectional-use predicate.
* `Turing.FinTM.nonnegative_heads` — [AB09, Claim 1.8].

/-- **Unidirectional tapes suffice** [AB09, Claim 1.8]: a `Γ`-machine computing `f`
within `T` is simulated, with the same number of work tapes and constant-factor
slowdown, by a machine over an enlarged alphabet whose work heads never visit negative
cells.

**Proof sketch.** Fold each tape at the origin along the coordinate
`φ z = if 0 ≤ z then z else -z - 1` (note `φ 0 = φ (-1) = 0`; this is *not* the
absolute value): physical cell `p ≥ 0` holds the two *independent* payloads —
simulated cell `p` and simulated cell `-p - 1`, each possibly blank — over the
enlarged non-blank alphabet `Γ' = Bool × Option Γ × Option Γ`, whose Boolean
component is an origin flag; `e γ = (false, some γ, none)` (injective via its first
payload), and an untouched physical blank decodes as two blanks with no flag. The
simulator's state tracks, per tape, which component the simulated head is in. Because
a transition cannot read a head coordinate, the origin is made *detectable* by a
fresh initialization state whose single action writes `(true, none, none)` at cell
`0` of every work tape simultaneously (one transition, length-independent); every
later write updates only the active payload, preserving the other payload and the
flag. Moves translate directly except at the fold: crossing between simulated cells `0`
and `-1` flips the component *without* issuing a physical move (the physical
coordinate stays `0`); each simulated step costs a constant number of physical steps,
giving `c · (T n + 1)` — [AB09] gets `4T`. Physical head positions are values of `φ`,
hence nonnegative; on enlarged-alphabet inputs containing symbols outside the range
of `e` — where no functional behavior is promised but `NonnegativeHeads` still
quantifies — the simulator halts safely on first contact, preserving nonnegativity
(phase-2 audit, finding 10 and case A14). The folding invariant transfers computation
and halting on embedded inputs. -/
