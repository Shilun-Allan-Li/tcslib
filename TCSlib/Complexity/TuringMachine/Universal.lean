# The universal Turing machine

[AB09, §1.4.1 and Theorem 1.9, relaxed form]: there is a single machine `U` that,
given a code and an input, simulates the machine the code denotes — `U(x, α) =
M_α(x)` — with the simulation overhead depending only on the code, not on the input.

## Design and deviations from [AB09] (all shaped by the phase-3 audit)

* Statements are relative to an `Turing.EffectiveMachineCode`: the purely algebraic
  scheme admits noncomputable-meaning pathologies against which no universal machine
  exists (audit finding 1, Argument A).
* **Input layout is `pairEncode α x` — code first, input second** — deviating from
  [AB09]'s `⟨x, α⟩`: with the input first, the startup cost of reaching the code
  grows with `|x|` and the stated bounds are false (audit finding 2, Argument B).
  With the code first, startup (parsing and canonizing `α`) costs a constant
  depending only on `α`, absorbed into `C`, and the simulated input head walks the
  verbatim `x` region on demand.
* `universal` is the **all-string evaluator** [AB09's `U(x, α) = M_α(x)`, p. 20]:
  it covers every `α` through `c.decode` (padded and fallback representations
  included), the constant `C` may depend on `α` (it absorbs decoding/canonization),
  and it carries **both directions** — the forward time bound, and the converse that
  any output `U` produces is an output of the simulated machine, so divergence is
  preserved (audit finding 3).
* **The core bound is linear**, `C · (t + 1)`: coded machines are already in
  one-work-tape binary normal form, so `U` pays a constant per simulated step.
  [AB09]'s relaxed quadratic bound reappears in `universal_quadratic`, where an
  *arbitrary* binary machine is first normal-formed ([AB09, Claims 1.5-1.6]); that
  corollary is stated — and labeled — at the level of **total function computation**
  (audit finding 4), the machine-level partial statement being `universal` itself.
  The `O(T log T)` sharpening ([AB09, §1.7]) is the phase-5 stretch goal.
* `timed_universal` outputs `true :: output` on success and `[false]` on timeout, a
  concrete rendering of [AB09]'s "special failure symbol" (§1.4.1); its budget is
  quadratic (binary clock maintenance). The deadline convention: halting is checked
  after every simulated transition *including the `t`-th*, so a machine first
  halting exactly at the deadline is a success; at budget `0` no initialized machine
  has halted, and the timeout branch applies (audit finding 6).

## Main results

* `Turing.universal` — the all-string evaluator [AB09, Theorem 1.9 core].
* `Turing.universal_quadratic` — the relaxed quadratic form for total functions of
  arbitrary binary machines [AB09, Theorem 1.9 as proved in §1.4.1].
* `Turing.timed_universal` — the time-bounded universal machine [AB09, §1.4.1].

/-- **The universal machine as an all-string evaluator** [AB09, Theorem 1.9]: for any
effective scheme there is a single machine `U` such that for every string `α` there
is a constant `C` (depending on `α`, absorbing its decoding) with, for every input
`x`: whenever the machine `α` denotes halts on `x` within `t` steps with `output`,
`U` on `pairEncode α x` halts with the same output within `C · (t + 1)` steps —
and conversely every output `U` produces on `pairEncode α x` is an output the
denoted machine produces on `x`, so divergence is preserved.

**Proof sketch** (after [AB09, Figure 1.6], adapted to the code-first layout).
Startup: `U` runs the scheme's `canonizer` on the doubled-bit `α`-region (via the
composition combinators), leaving the fixed serialization of `M := c.decode α` — the
state count, initial state, and table — on a *table* work tape, and writes the
initial state on a *state* tape; cost `O(canonizerTime |α| + |α| + 1)`, a constant
for fixed `α`, absorbed into `C`. `U`'s input head then parks at the start of the
verbatim `x` region, and a *work* tape mirrors `M`'s work tape. Each simulated step:
read the mirrored work symbol and the input symbol under the simulated head (the
input head moves one cell per simulated move — `x` is verbatim, no doubling), scan
the table for the record matching (state, input read, work read) — at most the table
length, constant in `t` — and apply it: update the state tape, write/move on the
mirrored tape, emit `M`'s emission verbatim. Forward bound: `C · (t + 1)`. Converse:
`U` emits only what the simulation emits and halts only when the simulation halts,
so any completed output of `U` is an output of `M` on `x`. -/

/-- **The relaxed quadratic form, for total functions** [AB09, Theorem 1.9 as proved
in §1.4.1 — labeled per audit finding 4: this is the total-function corollary; the
machine-level, partial-computation statement is `Turing.universal`]: every binary
machine computing a total function `f` within `T` has a code `α` such that the
*same* universal machine computes `f x` from `pairEncode α x` within
`C · (T |x| + 1)²`.

**Proof sketch.** Normal-form the machine with `Turing.FinTM.one_work_tape_binary`
(quadratic, [AB09, Claims 1.5-1.6]), relabel its states with `Turing.exists_codeTM`,
take `α := c.encode` of that coded machine (so `c.decode α` is that machine, by
`MachineCode.decode_encode`), and apply the forward direction of `Turing.universal`;
the constants compose as `C_U · (c₁ · (T n + 1)² + 1) ≤ C · (T n + 1)²`. -/

/-- **The time-bounded universal machine** [AB09, §1.4.1, "Universal TM with time
bound"]: a single machine that, given `⟨⟨⌞t⌟, α⟩, x⟩` (clock and code first, input
last), simulates the machine `α` denotes on `x` for at most `t` steps, reporting
success (`true :: output`) or timeout (`[false]`).

**Proof sketch.** Extend the simulation of `Turing.universal` with a binary
countdown clock on a further work tape, initialized from `⌞t⌟ = Nat.bits t` (parsed
from the doubled-bit region; cost `O(t + 1)`, within budget). Each simulated step
costs an additional `O((Nat.bits t).length + 1)` for the decrement, whence the
quadratic budget; `M`'s emissions are buffered on a work tape rather than emitted
(their total length is at most `t`, by `Turing.MultiTapeTM.output_length_le`).
Halting is checked after each simulated transition, **including the `t`-th**: if the
simulated machine has halted by the time the clock expires — deadline included —
`U` emits `true` and flushes the buffer; otherwise it emits `false`. At `t = 0` no
initialized machine has halted (`Turing.FinTM.not_computesInTime_zero`), and the
timeout branch applies (audit finding 6). The two cases below are exhaustive:
either some output witnesses halting within `t`, or every output fails to. -/

          [false] (C * (t + 1) ^ 2)) := by
