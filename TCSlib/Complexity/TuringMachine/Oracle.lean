# Oracle Turing machines

An oracle Turing machine [AB09, §3.4, Definition 3.4; pulled forward to Chapter 1 to
validate the model architecture] is a multi-tape machine with one additional designated
*query tape* and three designated states `qQuery`, `qYes`, `qNo`. Whenever the machine
enters `qQuery`, the string currently written on the query tape is submitted to the oracle
`O`: in a single step the machine moves to `qYes` if the query is in `O` and to `qNo`
otherwise, with all tapes and heads unchanged.

## Design

This file is the architectural test of the `Action`/`Action.apply` split: an oracle machine
reuses the configurations `Turing.Cfg (k + 1)` (the query tape is the extra work tape, at
index `Fin.last k`) and the action application of the plain model, and differs *only* in how
the next action is chosen — the step function is parametrized by the oracle
`O : Language Symbol`. Time and space measures therefore transfer unchanged.

Definitional choices worth auditing:

* **The query string** (`OracleTM.queryString`) is read from cell `0` of the query tape
  rightward up to (excluding) the first blank cell; if the whole nonnegative half-tape is
  blank-free (possible for an arbitrary configuration, though not for one reachable from an
  initial configuration), the query is defined to be `[]`. [AB09] leaves the extraction
  convention implicit; this is one concrete faithful reading.
* **The answer step** changes only the state; heads and tapes stay put. Some texts
  instead erase the query tape on each answer. The two conventions are equivalent up to
  *polynomial* overhead, but **not** constant overhead: computing the parity of `n`
  distinct length-`n` queries takes `O(n)` steps with a persistent tape and `Ω(n²)`
  steps with auto-erasure (`audits/phase1-findings.md`, finding 3, case 12).
  Consequently, exact `DTIME`-level bounds must never be transferred across this
  convention; class-level results (`Pᴼ` etc.) are unaffected.
* `qYes`/`qNo` are ordinary states from the machine's point of view (its transition
  function handles them); only `qQuery` triggers special behavior. The machine may query
  repeatedly. This reading presumes the three special states are pairwise distinct,
  which the raw structure does not enforce (e.g. with `qYes = qQuery` the machine
  re-queries forever after a positive answer): results at the faithful interface assume
  `OracleTM.WellFormed`. Note that
  `q₀ = qQuery` is legitimate and deliberately allowed (the machine then submits the
  empty query on its first step).

## Main definitions

* `Turing.OracleTM` — the oracle machine. [AB09, Definition 3.4]
* `Turing.OracleTM.WellFormed` — the three special states are pairwise distinct; the
  standing hypothesis of the faithful interface (oracle complexity classes will require
  it).
* `Turing.OracleTM.step`, `Turing.OracleTM.runFrom` — semantics relative to an oracle.
* `Turing.OracleTM.ComputesInTime` — output and time bound relative to an oracle.
* `Turing.Action.extend`, `Turing.Action.mapState`, `Turing.Cfg.embedOracle`,
  `Turing.OracleTM.ofMultiTapeTM` — the embedding of plain machines as oracle machines
  that never query.
* `Turing.OracleTM.plainEmptyOracle` — the converse direction: an oracle machine run
  with the empty oracle, as a plain `k + 1`-tape machine in exact lockstep.

## Main results (sanity checks for the architecture)

* `Turing.OracleTM.step_eq_of_ne_qQuery` — away from `qQuery`, the step does not depend
  on the oracle.
* `Turing.OracleTM.ofMultiTapeTM_wellFormed` — the embedding produces well-formed
  machines.
* `Turing.OracleTM.runFrom_ofMultiTapeTM` — an embedded plain machine runs in lockstep
  with the original, under every oracle.
* `Turing.OracleTM.computesInTime_ofMultiTapeTM` — hence its input/output behavior and
  time bounds are oracle-independent and agree with the plain machine's.
* `Turing.OracleTM.runFrom_plainEmptyOracle` — the empty-oracle elimination runs in
  exact lockstep.
* `Turing.OracleTM.queryString_length_le` — in an initialized run, the query after `t`
  steps has length at most `t`.
* `Turing.OracleTM.runFrom_workTapes_blank` — in an initialized run, cells at distance
  `≥ t` are still blank after `t` steps; the certificate that the no-blank fallback in
  `queryString` is unreachable from initialization.

/-- An oracle Turing machine with `k` ordinary work tapes, one query tape (the work tape
of index `Fin.last k` in its configurations `Cfg (k + 1)`), and designated query and
answer states. Finiteness of `State` is deferred exactly as for `MultiTapeTM`, and so is
distinctness of the three special states: the raw structure allows them to coincide
(with degenerate behavior, e.g. `qYes = qQuery` re-queries forever after a positive
answer), and the faithful interface imposes `OracleTM.WellFormed`.

/-- Well-formedness of an oracle machine: the query state and the two answer states are
pairwise distinct. Without this, the advertised semantics degenerates: with
`qYes = qQuery` a positive answer re-queries the unchanged tape forever (a negative
answer may still reach a distinct `qNo` and halt normally), and with all three states
collapsed the machine loops once the common query state is reached (an initial state
elsewhere can still halt via the table without ever querying). Moreover `qYes = qNo`
alone makes the step function — hence every run — oblivious to the oracle. This is the
standing hypothesis of the faithful oracle interface —
oracle complexity classes will require it. `q₀ = qQuery` is deliberately allowed: such a
machine simply submits the empty query on its first step.

/-- In an initialized run, the query after `t` steps has length at most `t`. In
particular the no-blank fallback branch of `queryString` is unreachable from an initial

**Proof sketch.** By induction on `t`, every write performed in the first `t` steps
happened at a head position of absolute value at most `t - 1` (heads start at `0` and
move at most one cell per step, `Turing.workTapePos_apply_le`). Hence cell `t` of the

terminates at an index `≤ t`. -/

`queryString_length_le` alone does not certify this, since the fallback also returns a
short list).

**Proof sketch.** Simultaneous induction on `t` with the head-position bound
`|workTapePos i| ≤ t`: at `t = 0` all tapes are blank and heads are at `0`; an ordinary
step writes only at the *old* head position (of absolute value `≤ t`, hence `< t + 1`;
`Action.apply` writes before moving) and moves each head by at most one cell
(`Turing.workTapePos_apply_le`); oracle-answer and halted steps change no tape. -/

extended by three fresh states serving as `qQuery`, `qYes`, `qNo`, and the transition
function acts as before on original states (never moving into the fresh states, and
ignoring the query tape). The fresh states are unreachable from the initial
configuration. The *transition table* halts immediately from all three fresh states;
note that from `qQuery` itself the query override fires first (one answer step into

**Proof sketch.** By induction on `t` it suffices to show that `Cfg.embedOracle`
intertwines the two step functions. In a configuration `Cfg.embedOracle cfg` the state is
of the form `Sum.inl q` (or `none`), which is never `qQuery = Sum.inr 0`, so the oracle
step reduces to applying the extended action; and applying an extended, state-renamed
action to an embedded configuration is the embedding of applying the original action —
the extra tape is untouched (`Action.extend` neither writes nor moves it), and reads
agree because the embedded work tapes restrict to the original ones. -/

/-- An embedded plain machine has the same input/output behavior and time bounds as the

**Proof sketch.** `Cfg.embedOracle` sends the initial configuration of `tm` to the initial

`runFrom_ofMultiTapeTM` the runs correspond, and `Cfg.embedOracle` preserves haltedness

both sides are fixed. In state `qQuery` the oracle step answers `qNo` (nothing is in the
