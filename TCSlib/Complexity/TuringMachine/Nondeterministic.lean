# Nondeterministic Multi-Tape Turing Machines

[AB09, §2.1.2]: a nondeterministic Turing machine (NDTM) is a standard TM with **two**
transition functions `δ₀` and `δ₁`; at every step the machine chooses which of the two to
apply. A finite run is therefore governed by a *choice word* — one bit per step — and the
run function is indexed by it. This module defines the raw machine, its choice-word
semantics in the style of the deterministic `Turing.MultiTapeTM.runFrom`, the all-branch
halting predicate that time bounds quantify over, the bundled finite layer `FinNDTM`, and
the embedding of deterministic machines. Acceptance and the class `NTIME` live one layer
up, in `TCSlib.Complexity.ClassNP.NTIME`, because they fix the binary alphabet.

## Design and deviations from [AB09]

* **Two total transition functions, `Bool`-indexed**: the single field
  `tr : Bool → …` carries [AB09]'s `δ₀` as `tr false` and `δ₁` as `tr true`. Both
  functions are total, so no configuration is ever *stuck* — every choice word of every
  length drives a complete run. (This is the load-bearing difference from a
  relational model such as cslib's `MultiTapeNTM`, surveyed and deliberately not
  ported — see the plan's decision log: with binary choice the accepting choice word
  *is* the polynomial-length certificate of [AB09, Theorem 2.6], while arbitrary
  branching relations have no canonical certificate encoding.)
* **Choice words are finite lists** (`List Bool`), consumed left to right, one bit per
  step: `runWith w cfg` is the configuration after `|w|` steps under the choices `w`.
  The alternative — infinite choice streams `ℕ → Bool` with a separate step count — is
  equivalent for every notion built here (only the first `t` bits of a stream are ever
  consulted); the list form makes the choice word a finite string that can be a
  certificate. **Design question (c) for the phase-2 audit.**
* **No `q_accept` state.** [AB09] equips NDTMs with a distinguished accepting state;
  our machines signal through their output tape, exactly as the deterministic
  development does (`Turing.FinTM.DecidesInTime` reads acceptance off the output
  `[true]`/`[false]`). Acceptance-by-output is defined in
  `TCSlib.Complexity.ClassNP.NTIME` and is **design question (a) for the phase-2
  audit**.
* **Halting is absorbing under every choice**: stepping a halted configuration is the
  identity regardless of the choice bit, mirroring the deterministic `step`. Extending
  a choice word beyond the halting time therefore never changes the reached
  configuration — the lemma `runWith_of_halt` below. This is what the exact-length
  quantifiers lean on, *directionally*: accepting witnesses pad to any larger exact
  length, and all-branch halting at a larger budget follows by splitting at the old
  one (`HaltsWithin.mono`). It does **not** make every bounded-length rewriting valid —
  "every word of length at most `t` is halted" already fails at the empty word — and
  the correct bounded readings are recorded in `TCSlib.Complexity.ClassNP.NTIME`
  (round-1 audit, finding 2).
* The model reuses the vendored configuration layer (`Turing.Cfg`, `Turing.Action`)
  unchanged: an NDTM step applies an `Action` exactly as a deterministic step does; only
  the *selection* of the action is new.

## Main definitions

* `Turing.NDTM` — the binary-choice nondeterministic machine. [AB09, §2.1.2]
* `Turing.NDTM.stepWith`, `Turing.NDTM.runWith` — one step under a choice bit; the run
  under a choice word. [AB09, §2.1.2]
* `Turing.NDTM.HaltsWithin` — every choice word of length `t` halts the machine on the
  given input; the totality condition of [AB09]'s "runs in `T(n)` time".
* `Turing.FinNDTM` — the bundled finite layer, mirroring `Turing.FinTM`.
* `Turing.MultiTapeTM.toNDTM`, `Turing.FinTM.toFinNDTM` — a deterministic machine as an
  NDTM whose two transition functions coincide.

## Main results

* `Turing.NDTM.runWith_append`, `Turing.NDTM.runWith_of_halt` — the choice-word run
  algebra (proved; pure unfoldings, the nondeterministic counterparts of the vendored
  `runFrom` lemmas).
* `Turing.NDTM.HaltsWithin.mono` — all-branch halting is monotone in the time bound.
* `Turing.MultiTapeTM.toNDTM_runWith` — the embedded deterministic machine ignores its
  choices: every choice word of length `t` reproduces `runFrom` at time `t`.

nondeterministic choices the configuration is halted. This is the totality condition in
[AB09]'s "runs in `T(n)` time" (§2.1.2: *every* sequence of choices reaches the halting
state within the bound), rendered over choice words of length exactly `t`; by
`Turing.NDTM.runWith_of_halt` the exact-length quantifier already covers all longer

**Proof sketch.** Given `w` with `|w| = t' ≥ t`, split `w = w.take t ++ w.drop t`
(`List.take_append_drop`) with `|w.take t| = t` (`List.length_take`, since `t ≤ t'`).
By the hypothesis the run under `w.take t` is halted; `Turing.NDTM.runWith_append`
factors the run under `w` through it, and `Turing.NDTM.runWith_of_halt` absorbs the
remaining choices, so the state at `w` equals the halted state at `w.take t`. -/

**Proof sketch.** Induction on `w` generalizing the configuration. For one step,
`Turing.NDTM.stepWith` on `toNDTM` and `Turing.MultiTapeTM.step` are the same match on
the state — halted branches are both the identity, and on a live state both apply the
action `tm.tr q …` since `toNDTM.tr b = tm.tr` for either `b`. The cons case is then
`Turing.NDTM.runWith_cons` against `Turing.MultiTapeTM.runFrom_succ_eq_step` (the step
count on the right is `|w| + 1`, `List.length_cons`). -/
