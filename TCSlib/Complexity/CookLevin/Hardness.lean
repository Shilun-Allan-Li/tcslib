# The Cook-Levin theorem

[AB09, Theorem 2.10, via Lemma 2.11 and Lemma 2.14]: `SAT` and `3SAT` are
`NP`-complete. This module states the hardness results — the campaign's
summit. The mathematical heart (snapshots and locality over oblivious
machines) is stated in `TCSlib.Complexity.CookLevin.Snapshot`; the formula
layer is phase 3's; what remains here is the tableau assembly and the
polynomial-time machine that *emits* it, both carried by the `SAT_NPHard`
sketch as named fill obligations.

## Design and deviations from [AB09]

* **The tableau runs on our oblivious machines** ([AB09] footnote 5 direction,
  recorded in the plan §2): `Complexity.oblivious_of_mem_DTIME` supplies a
  quadratic, unrestricted-tape-count oblivious decider for the verifier
  language, oblivious on all inputs at every time; snapshots have constant
  size (state plus `k + 1` read symbols) and there are `k` last-visit wirings
  per step instead of [AB09]'s one.
* **The certificate enters as input variables**: the verifier's input is the
  concatenation `x ++ u` with `|u|` the audited explicit formula, so [AB09]'s
  `y`-variables (p. 49, condition 1) split into `n` variables pinned to `x`
  by **unit clauses** — Example 2.12's equality rendering degenerates because
  `x` is a constant — and `Q(n)` free certificate variables. **Seeded design
  question (d) for the phase-4 audit.**
* **Acceptance is the local family "no step emits `false`"**, replacing
  [AB09]'s condition 4 (final accepting snapshot): our deciders signal
  through the append-only output tape with output exactly `[true]`/`[false]`,
  the per-step emission is a function of the snapshot
  (`Complexity.emitted`), and a *valid* trace is a genuine run of the
  decider, which emits exactly one bit within the budget — so forbidding
  `false`-emissions forces the output `[true]`, with "at least one emission"
  supplied by the decider contract rather than by clauses. **Seeded design
  question (a) for the phase-4 audit** — the family leans on
  `Turing.FinTM.DecidesInTime`'s totality within the tableau's horizon.
* **The horizon is the budget, not a common halting time**: obliviousness
  constrains positions only (design question (c), `Snapshot.lean`), so the
  tableau has one snapshot block per time up to the decider's budget, with
  halted steps fixed by the reconstruction functions' halted branches.

## Main results

* `Complexity.NPHard.polyTimeReducible` — hardness transfers forward along
  reductions ([AB09, §2.2] with Theorem 2.8's transitivity; a **new statement
  on the audited phase-1 notions**, flagged).
* `Complexity.SAT_NPHard` — [AB09, Lemma 2.11].
* `Complexity.SAT_NPComplete` — [AB09, Theorem 2.10.1].
* `Complexity.SAT3_NPHard`, `Complexity.SAT3_NPComplete` —
  [AB09, Theorem 2.10.2, via Lemma 2.14].

new statement on the audited phase-1 notions, flagged per standing practice.)

/-- **Lemma 2.11 (Cook-Levin hardness)** [AB09]: `SAT` is `NP`-hard.

**Proof sketch.** Fix `L ∈ NP` with certificate length `Q n = C₀(n+1)^(c₀)`
and verifier language `V ∈ P`.

**(1) Normalization.** `Complexity.mem_P_iff` gives a decider for `V` within
`A(m+1)^d`; enlarge to `A ≥ 1, d ≥ 1` (`Turing.FinTM.ComputesInTime.mono`),
so `Complexity.timeConstructible_poly A (d-1)` makes the bound
time-constructible, and `Complexity.oblivious_of_mem_DTIME` yields an
oblivious `M` and constant `c` with `M.DecidesInTime V T*`, where
`T* m = c(A(m+1)^d + 1)^2` — an explicit polynomial. On inputs of length
`m = n + Q n` (the verifier reads `x ++ u`), write `T = T* m` for the
tableau horizon; `M`'s schedule and last-visit data are
`Complexity.inputPosAt`/`workPosAt`/`prevVisit` at length `m`.

**(2) Variables of `φ_x`** ([AB09] p. 49, adapted): input variables
`y_0, …, y_{m-1}` — the first `n` pinned to `x`'s bits, the last `Q n` free
(the certificate; design question (d)) — and snapshot-block variables
`z_{t,0}, …, z_{t,B-1}` for `0 ≤ t ≤ T`, where `B` is the bit size of a fixed
injective encoding of `Complexity.Snapshot M` (a constant of `M`); index
packing `y_j ↦ j`, `z_{t,i} ↦ m + tB + i` — explicit arithmetic, unary
serialization polynomial since all indices are `≤ m + (T+1)B`.

**(3) Clause families**, each of constant size per member except where noted,
each obtained from a Boolean function on constantly many block bits via
`Complexity.exists_cnf_boolFun` (Claim 2.13) composed with the index packing
(a relabeling — `Std.Sat.CNF.relabel` is the carrier's tool):
(i) *pinning*: `n` unit clauses forcing `y_j = x_j` for `j < n`;
(ii) *initial block*: clauses forcing `z_0` to encode
`⟨some q₀, input read, blanks⟩` per `Complexity.snapshotAt_zero`, with the
input-read component wired to `y`-variables at position `inputPosAt m 0 = 1`
(boundary blank cases folded in as constants);
(iii) *state succession*: for each `t < T`, clauses forcing `z_{t+1}`'s state
field to `Complexity.stepState` of `z_t`'s decoded block
(`Complexity.snapshotAt_state_succ`);
(iv) *input-read wiring*: for each `t ≤ T`, clauses forcing `z_t`'s
input-symbol field to the `y`-variable at `inputPosAt m t` (or the constant
blank at boundary positions) — [AB09]'s `y_inputpos(i)`
(`Complexity.snapshotAt_inputSymbol`);
(v) *work-read wiring*: for each `t ≤ T` and each of the `k` tapes `τ`,
clauses forcing `z_t`'s `τ`-read field to
`Complexity.writtenOrKept` of the block at `prevVisit m t τ`, or to the
constant blank when `prevVisit = none`
(`Complexity.snapshotAt_workSymbol`; the `k` wirings per step generalize
[AB09]'s single `z_prev(i)`);
(vi) *acceptance*: for each `t < T`, clauses forbidding
`Complexity.emitted` of `z_t`'s decoded block from being `some false`
(design question (a); [AB09]'s condition 4 replaced — see the deviations
list). Block decoding is totalized (junk bit patterns decode to a fixed
snapshot — the `codeFallback` convention), and the forcing clauses pin each
`z_t` **bitwise** to the encoding of the reconstructed snapshot, so no junk
assignment survives family (ii)-(v).

**(4) Correctness**: `φ_x` satisfiable iff `x ∈ L`. (⇐) For `x ∈ L` take the
witness `u`, assign `y := x ++ u` and `z_t :=` the encoding of
`Complexity.snapshotAt M (x ++ u) t`: families (i)-(v) hold by the four
snapshot theorems, and (vi) holds because the genuine run's emissions
concatenate to `M`'s output `[true]` (`Turing.MultiTapeTM.step_output`
chained; `x ++ u ∈ V` since `u` witnesses membership). (⇒) A satisfying
assignment reads off `u` from the free `y`-variables; by induction on `t`,
families (ii)-(v) force every `z_t` to equal the encoding of the genuine
snapshot of the run on `x ++ u` — at each step the four snapshot theorems
say the genuine snapshot satisfies the same reconstruction equations, and
the bitwise pinning makes the solution unique. The run halts within `T`
(`M.DecidesInTime`, totality), its output is `[true]` or `[false]`
(the indicator contract), the emissions are the `Complexity.emitted` values
of the genuine snapshots, and family (vi) rules out `[false]`: so
`x ++ u ∈ V`, hence `x ∈ L`. Both directions quantify over **all** `u` of
the exact audited length — no bounded-length slippage.

**(5) The emitting machine** — `f x := Std.Sat.CNF.serialize φ_x`, with
`Complexity.PolyTimeComputable f` by the named obligations: evaluate `Q n`,
`m`, and `T* m` (`Complexity.timeConstructible_poly` and the exact-value
discipline of the phase-3 audit); **compute the schedule by clocked
simulation on the reference input** `List.replicate m false` — the
definitional reference input of `Complexity.inputPosAt`/`workPosAt` — for
`T` steps, recording positions in binary (`O(log T)` bits each;
per-step simulation of the *fixed* machine `M` at constant state cost plus
polynomial bookkeeping; the `Simulation` lockstep gadgets and the phase-2
compilation obligations are the precedents); derive `prevVisit m t τ` by
position comparison against the recorded trajectory (quadratically many
comparisons of `O(log T)`-bit integers); emit the clause families in the
fixed order (2)-(3) with the packed indices written in unary (run-length
emission driven by binary counters); the constant per-family clause tables
are hardwired finite-control data of the fixed `M` (Claim 2.13 applied once,
off-line, to `M`'s finitely many reconstruction functions). Output length:
`O(n) + O(T·(m + TB)·const)` unary-serialized — an explicit polynomial in
`n`; time polynomial likewise.

**(6) Conclusion.** `x ∈ L ↔ φ_x` satisfiable
`↔ f x ∈ SAT` (`Std.Sat.CNF.decode_serialize`), so `L ≤ₚ SAT` via
`Complexity.PolyTimeReducible`; quantify over `L ∈ NP` for
`Complexity.NPHard`. -/
