# The Cook-Levin theorem

[AB09, Theorem 2.10, via Lemma 2.11 and Lemma 2.14]: `SAT` and `3SAT` are
`NP`-complete. This module states the hardness results — the campaign's
summit. The mathematical heart (snapshots and locality over oblivious
machines) is stated in `TCSlib.Complexity.CookLevin.Snapshot`; the formula
layer is phase 3's; what remains here is the tableau assembly and the
polynomial-time machine that *emits* it, both carried by the `SAT_NPHard`
sketch as named fill obligations.

## Design and deviations from [AB09]

* **The tableau runs on our oblivious machines** ([AB09] footnote 5 direction,
  recorded in the plan §2): `Complexity.oblivious_of_mem_DTIME` supplies a
  quadratic, unrestricted-tape-count oblivious decider for the verifier
  language, oblivious on all inputs at every time; snapshots have constant
  size (state plus `k + 1` read symbols) and there are `k` last-visit wirings
  per step instead of [AB09]'s one.
* **The certificate enters as input variables**: the verifier's input is the
  concatenation `x ++ u` with `|u|` the audited explicit formula, so [AB09]'s
  `y`-variables (p. 49, condition 1) split into `n` variables pinned to `x`
  by **unit clauses** — Example 2.12's equality rendering degenerates because
  `x` is a constant — and `Q(n)` free certificate variables. **Seeded design
  question (d) for the phase-4 audit.**
* **Acceptance is the local family "no step emits `false`"**, replacing
  [AB09]'s condition 4 (final accepting snapshot): our deciders signal
  through the append-only output tape with output exactly `[true]`/`[false]`,
  the per-step emission is a function of the snapshot
  (`Complexity.emitted`), and a *valid* trace is a genuine run of the
  decider, which emits exactly one bit within the budget — so forbidding
  `false`-emissions forces the output `[true]`, with "at least one emission"
  supplied by the decider contract rather than by clauses. **Seeded design
  question (a) for the phase-4 audit** — the family leans on
  `Turing.FinTM.DecidesInTime`'s totality within the tableau's horizon.
* **The horizon is the budget, not a common halting time**: obliviousness
  constrains positions only (design question (c), `Snapshot.lean`), so the
  tableau has one snapshot block per time up to the decider's budget, with
  halted steps fixed by the reconstruction functions' halted branches.

## Main results

* `Complexity.NPHard.polyTimeReducible` — hardness transfers forward along
  reductions ([AB09, §2.2] with Theorem 2.8's transitivity; a **new statement
  on the audited phase-1 notions**, flagged).
* `Complexity.SAT_NPHard` — [AB09, Lemma 2.11].
* `Complexity.SAT_NPComplete` — [AB09, Theorem 2.10.1].
* `Complexity.SAT3_NPHard`, `Complexity.SAT3_NPComplete` —
  [AB09, Theorem 2.10.2, via Lemma 2.14].

reduces to `L` and `L ≤ₚ L'`, then every `NP` language reduces to `L'`. (A
new statement on the audited phase-1 notions, flagged per standing practice.)

/-- **Lemma 2.11 (Cook-Levin hardness)** [AB09]: `SAT` is `NP`-hard.

**Proof sketch.** Fix `L ∈ NP` with certificate length `Q n = C₀(n+1)^(c₀)`
and verifier language `V ∈ P`.

**(1) Normalization.** `Complexity.mem_P_iff` gives a decider for `V` within
`A(m+1)^d`; enlarge to `A ≥ 1, d ≥ 1` (`Turing.FinTM.ComputesInTime.mono`),
so `Complexity.timeConstructible_poly A (d-1)` makes the bound
time-constructible, and `Complexity.oblivious_of_mem_DTIME` yields an
oblivious `M` and constant `c` with `M.DecidesInTime V T*`, where
`T* m = c(A(m+1)^d + 1)^2` — an explicit polynomial. On inputs of length
`m = n + Q n` (the verifier reads `x ++ u`), write `T = T* m` for the
tableau horizon; `M`'s schedule and last-visit data are
`Complexity.inputPosAt`/`workPosAt`/`prevVisit` at length `m`.

**(2) Variables of `φ_x`** ([AB09] p. 49, adapted): input variables
`y_0, …, y_{m-1}` — the first `n` pinned to `x`'s bits, the last `Q n` free
(the certificate; design question (d)) — and snapshot-block variables
`z_{t,0}, …, z_{t,B-1}` for `0 ≤ t ≤ T`, where `B` is the bit size of a fixed
injective **product** encoding of `Complexity.Snapshot M` — a fixed code for
the optional state followed by fixed codes for the input symbol and each
work symbol, so the block's fields are literal slices of the block and the
bitwise pinning of family (ii)-(v) is per-field (round-1 audit, note 5) —
with a totalized decoder (`dec (enc s) = s`; junk patterns decode to a fixed
snapshot). `B` is a constant of `M`. Index packing `y_j ↦ j`,
`z_{t,i} ↦ m + tB + i` — explicit arithmetic, disjoint and injective by
quotient/remainder by `B`, unary serialization polynomial since all indices
are `< m + (T+1)B`.

**(3) Clause families**, each of constant size per member except where noted,
each obtained from a Boolean function on constantly many block bits via
`Complexity.exists_cnf_boolFun` (Claim 2.13) composed with the index packing
(a relabeling — `Std.Sat.CNF.relabel` is the carrier's tool):
(i) *pinning*: `n` unit clauses forcing `y_j = x_j` for `j < n`;
(ii) *initial block*: clauses forcing `z_0` to encode
`⟨some q₀, input read, blanks⟩` per `Complexity.snapshotAt_zero`, with the
input-read component wired to `y`-variables at position `inputPosAt m 0 = 1`
(boundary blank cases folded in as constants);
(iii) *state succession*: for each `t < T`, clauses forcing `z_{t+1}`'s state
field to `Complexity.stepState` of `z_t`'s decoded block
(`Complexity.snapshotAt_state_succ`);
(iv) *input-read wiring*: for each `t ≤ T`, clauses forcing `z_t`'s
input-symbol field to the `y`-variable at `inputPosAt m t` (or the constant
blank at boundary positions) — [AB09]'s `y_inputpos(i)`
(`Complexity.snapshotAt_inputSymbol`);
(v) *work-read wiring*: for each `t ≤ T` and each of the `k` tapes `τ`,
clauses forcing `z_t`'s `τ`-read field to
`Complexity.writtenOrKept` of the block at `prevVisit m t τ`, or to the
constant blank when `prevVisit = none`
(`Complexity.snapshotAt_workSymbol`; the `k` wirings per step generalize
[AB09]'s single `z_prev(i)`);
(vi) *acceptance*: for each `t < T`, clauses forbidding
`Complexity.emitted` of `z_t`'s decoded block from being `some false`
(design question (a); [AB09]'s condition 4 replaced — see the deviations
list). Block decoding is totalized (junk bit patterns decode to a fixed
snapshot — the `codeFallback` convention), and the forcing clauses pin each
`z_t` **bitwise** to the encoding of the reconstructed snapshot, so no junk
assignment survives family (ii)-(v).

**(4) Correctness**: `φ_x` satisfiable iff `x ∈ L`. (⇐) For `x ∈ L` take the
witness `u`, assign `y := x ++ u` and `z_t :=` the encoding of
`Complexity.snapshotAt M (x ++ u) t`: families (i)-(v) hold by the four
snapshot theorems, and (vi) holds because the genuine run's emissions
concatenate to `M`'s output `[true]` (`Turing.MultiTapeTM.step_output`
chained; `x ++ u ∈ V` since `u` witnesses membership). (⇒) A satisfying
assignment reads off `u` from the free `y`-variables; by induction on `t`,
families (ii)-(v) force every `z_t` to equal the encoding of the genuine
snapshot of the run on `x ++ u` — at each step the four snapshot theorems
say the genuine snapshot satisfies the same reconstruction equations, and
the bitwise pinning makes the solution unique. The run halts within `T`
(`M.DecidesInTime`, totality), its output is `[true]` or `[false]`
(the indicator contract), the emissions are the `Complexity.emitted` values
of the genuine snapshots, and family (vi) rules out `[false]`: so
`x ++ u ∈ V`, hence `x ∈ L`. Both directions quantify over **all** `u` of
the exact audited length — no bounded-length slippage.

**(5) The emitting machine** — `f x := Std.Sat.CNF.serialize φ_x`, with
`Complexity.PolyTimeComputable f` by the staged obligations below, every
stage under the **output-silence contract** (round-1 audit, finding 1): the
preparatory machines' answers are captured on work tapes and their
emissions discarded — `Complexity.timeConstructible_poly`'s machines answer
on the real output tape, and the reference simulation of `M` emits its
verdict bit, so unwrapped forwarding would prefix the serialization and
collapse the emitted word to the fallback (the audit's concrete false
positive: `[false] ++ serialize φ_x` fails exact consumption and decodes to
`[] ∈ SAT`); likewise a forwarded source *halt* would strand the output at
`[false] = serialize []`. **Invariant: the physical output is empty before
serialization, and equals the emitted serialization prefix thereafter.**
Stages (the audit's contract table, adopted verbatim):
(s1) *exact arithmetic* — retain `x`; compute the exact `Q n`, `m`, and `T`
(the phase-3 exact-value discipline), capturing binary subroutine answers on
work tapes and returning control with empty physical output;
(s2) *reference simulation* — present the **virtual** input
`List.replicate m false` (the definitional reference input of
`Complexity.inputPosAt`/`workPosAt`), virtual head starting at `1` and
clamped to `0..m+1`, on disjoint work tapes: the physical input is still
`x`, so native-input embeddings alone do not suffice;
(s3) *simulation output and halt* — discard the source's output field, keep
an **internal** halted flag rather than halting the controller, and after
source halting record the frozen positions until the clock reaches `T`;
(s4) *trajectory* — record times `0..T` inclusive, work counters matching
the signed source positions and input counters the clamped reference
positions (`O(log T)` bits each); administrative controller steps do not
count as simulated time;
(s5) *last visits* — for each target time and tape, compare all earlier
recorded positions and keep the greatest match, or `none` (`O(k·T²)`
comparisons of `O(log T)`-bit integers, with sequential-scan access costs —
polynomial feasibility, no random-access assumption);
(s6) *serialization* — emit the clause families in the fixed order of
(2)-(3) with packed indices in unary (run-length emission driven by binary
counters), every marker and the final terminator included, and halt only
after completion. The constant per-family clause tables are hardwired
finite-control data of the fixed `M` (Claim 2.13 applied once, off-line, to
`M`'s finitely many reconstruction functions); the `Simulation` lockstep
gadgets and the buffered-capture precedents are usable *components*, but the
bare embeddings forward output and halts and are **not** substitutes for
these contracts. Output length — the fill's ledger is the exact identity
`|serialize φ_x| = 1 + 2·#clauses + Σ_{(v,b) occurrence} (v + 3)`; the
pinning family alone costs `n(n-1)/2 + 5n` bits (its unary indices grow),
absorbed by the dominant terms since `T ≥ (m+1)²` — in all an explicit
polynomial in `n`, and time polynomial likewise.

**(6) Conclusion.** `x ∈ L ↔ φ_x` satisfiable
`↔ f x ∈ SAT` (`Std.Sat.CNF.decode_serialize`), so `L ≤ₚ SAT` via
`Complexity.PolyTimeReducible`; quantify over `L ∈ NP` for
`Complexity.NPHard`. -/
