# Time-constructible functions

A function `T : ℕ → ℕ` is *time constructible* if `T n ≥ n` and some machine computes,
on every input `x`, the binary representation of `T |x|` within at most
`c · (T |x| + 1)` steps for a positive constant `c`. [AB09, §1.3, with the audit-mandated
budget repair below.] Time constructibility rules out pathological time bounds. It is
needed when a machine must *generate* a step budget from its input length, as in the
hierarchy theorems; note that the timed universal machine of [AB09, p. 21] receives its
budget as an explicit extra input and needs no constructibility hypothesis.

## Design and deviations from [AB09]

* Binary representation is `Nat.bits` (least-significant-bit first, with no redundant
  most-significant zeros; `Nat.bits 0 = []`), where [AB09] writes `⌞T(|x|)⌟` without
  fixing endianness. Nothing in Chapter 1 depends on the choice.
* **Deviation (audit-mandated).** [AB09] demands the computation run within exactly
  `T n` steps and then asserts that `n`, `n log n`, `n²`, `2ⁿ` are time constructible.
  The phase-1 external audit (`audits/phase1-findings.md`, finding 1, adversarial cases
  5-6) *proved the literal reading false in this model*: under the exact bound, the
  identity function — [AB09]'s own first example — is not time constructible (on the
  budget `T n = n`, the first transition on `[false]` and `[false, false]` is the same
  function call, and the length-1 budget forces it to halt with output `[true]`, which
  absorption then freezes at length 2), and even `T n = n + 1` fails by an append-only
  prefix argument. We therefore allow a positive constant factor on `T n + 1`, which
  suffices for every downstream use and restores the book's examples *after small-input
  normalization*: the literal `n · ⌈log₂ n⌉`, for instance, still violates `T n ≥ n` at
  `n = 1`, so such examples are stated with a `max`-with-`n` or `+ 1` normalization.
  Exact constants in downstream results must be derived from this form, not inherited
  from the strict reading.

## Main definitions

* `Complexity.TimeConstructible` — [AB09, §1.3], with the constant-slack repair above.

## Main results

* `Complexity.timeConstructible_id` — the identity function is time constructible,
  restoring [AB09]'s example under the repaired definition.

/-- The identity function is time constructible. [AB09, §1.3 examples]

**Proof sketch.** A one-work-tape machine maintains a little-endian binary counter on
its work tape while scanning the input left to right: for each input symbol it
increments the counter (walking right over `true` cells turning them `false` until the
first `false`/blank cell, which becomes `true`, then returning to cell 0). Incrementing
`n` times costs amortized `O(1)` per increment, `O(n)` in total. When the input head
reads the blank past the input, the machine walks the counter left to right emitting
each bit to the output tape (`O(log n)` steps) and halts. The total is at most
`c · (n + 1)` steps for an absolute constant `c`, and the emitted string is `n.bits`
(for `n = 0` the counter region is empty and nothing is emitted, matching
`Nat.bits 0 = []`). The formal proof uses twice the number of true counter bits as
potential: elapsed time plus potential is at most `4n` after `n` increments.
Entering emission and its final halting transition add two steps; the output length
is at most `n`, so `c = 5` suffices. -/
