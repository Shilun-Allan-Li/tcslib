# Space-constructible functions

[AB09, §4.1, p. 79]: `S : ℕ → ℕ` is space-constructible when some machine
computes `S(|x|)` from `x` within `O(S(|x|))` space, and the book's standing
convention is `S(n) > log n`. The definition mirrors
`Complexity.TimeConstructible` — output in binary (`Nat.bits`), constant slack
`c · S n` (the exact-bound variant is refuted in this model for the same reason
as in time, `audits/phase1-findings.md` finding 1) — and carries the book's
convention as the conjunct `∀ n, logSpace n ≤ S n`, so that downstream
statements (the space hierarchy, Savitch) can draw on it without restating it;
results needing only weaker hypotheses must say so (seeded to the P4.1 audit).

## Main definitions

* `Complexity.SpaceConstructible` — the binary-output, constant-slack,
  above-log form. [AB09, §4.1, p. 79]

## Main results (sorried; phase-P4.1 statements)

* `Complexity.spaceConstructible_logSpace` — `log` is space-constructible.
* `Complexity.spaceConstructible_linear` — `n + 1` is space-constructible.

/-- A function `S` is **space-constructible** when it dominates the logarithm
(`Complexity.logSpace`, the book's standing `S(n) > log n` convention carried as
data) and some machine computes the binary representation of `S (|x|)` from `x`
within `c · S (|x|)` visited work-tape cells. Mirrors
`Complexity.TimeConstructible` (binary output via `Nat.bits`, constant slack).

/-- **The logarithm is space-constructible.** [AB09, p. 79: "all functions of
interest, including `log n`, …, are space-constructible"]

**Proof sketch.** Fill obligations: a machine that (i) counts the input length
in binary on a work tape by one left-to-right input scan with a binary
increment at each step (the `Turing.counterTM`/`incrementTM` idiom — P11 of
`machine-library-design.md` §4, space-annotated per §12 R3), using
`|bits n| = logSpace n` cells for the counter; then (ii) computes the bit-length
of that counter word — a second unary-to-binary count over `logSpace n` cells —
and emits its bits. Total space `O(logSpace n)`; the dominance conjunct is
`le_refl` at `S = logSpace`. -/

/-- **Linear space is constructible**: `n ↦ n + 1` is space-constructible (the
`+ 1` avoids the vacuous zero bound at `n = 0`, as in the campaign's polynomial
normal forms).

**Proof sketch.** The same input-scan counter as in
`Complexity.spaceConstructible_logSpace`, with the space budget now dominated by
the counter's `logSpace n ≤ n + 1` cells; dominance is `logSpace n ≤ n + 1`
(`Nat.log_lt` / induction — a small arithmetic lemma). -/
