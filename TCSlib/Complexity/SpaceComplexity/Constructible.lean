# Space-constructible functions

[AB09, §4.1, p. 79]: `S : ℕ → ℕ` is space-constructible when some machine
computes `S(|x|)` from `x` within `O(S(|x|))` space, and the book's standing
convention is `S(n) > log n`. The definition mirrors
`Complexity.TimeConstructible` — output in binary (`Nat.bits`), constant slack
`c · S n`, which implements the book's own asymptotic space convention
([AB09, p. 79]: "computes `S(|x|)` in `O(S(|x|))` space"); whether an
exact-space variant is also satisfiable is a separate question this campaign
does not pose (the chapter-1 exact-**time** refutation does not transfer: a
space deadline forces no premature halt — round-1 audit, finding 3) — and
carries the book's
convention as the conjunct `∀ n, logSpace n ≤ S n`, so that downstream
statements (the space hierarchy, Savitch) can draw on it without restating it;
results needing only weaker hypotheses must say so (seeded to the P4.1 audit).

## Main definitions

* `Complexity.SpaceConstructible` — the binary-output, constant-slack,
  above-log form. [AB09, §4.1, p. 79]

## Main results (sorried; phase-P4.1 statements)

* `Complexity.spaceConstructible_logSpace` — `log` is space-constructible.
* `Complexity.spaceConstructible_linear` — `n + 1` is space-constructible.

/-- A function `S` is **space-constructible** when it dominates the logarithm
(`Complexity.logSpace`, the book's standing `S(n) > log n` convention carried as
data) and some machine computes the binary representation of `S (|x|)` from `x`
within `c · S (|x|)` visited work-tape cells. Mirrors
`Complexity.TimeConstructible` (binary output via `Nat.bits`, constant slack).

/-- **The logarithm is space-constructible.** [AB09, p. 79: "all functions of
interest, including `log n`, …, are space-constructible"]

**Proof sketch.** Fill obligations: a machine that (i) counts the input length
in binary on a work tape by one left-to-right input scan with a binary
increment at each step (the `Turing.counterTM`/`incrementTM` idiom — P11 of
`machine-library-design.md` §4, space-annotated per §12 R3) — the counter word
has `|Nat.bits n| = logSpace n` cells **for `n > 0` only** (`Nat.bits 0 = []`
has length `0 ≠ logSpace 0 = 1`; round-1 audit, finding 1), so (ii) the empty
input is special-cased to emit `(logSpace 0).bits = [true]` directly, and
otherwise the machine computes the counter word's bit-length by a second count
and emits its bits. Space: the counters and markers fit in
`A·(logSpace n + 1) ≤ 2A·logSpace n` visited cells (boundary cells included
before absorbing, since `logSpace n ≥ 1`); the dominance conjunct is `le_refl`
at `S = logSpace`. -/

/-- **Linear space is constructible**: `n ↦ n + 1` is space-constructible (the
`+ 1` prevents the inherited zero-bound collapse at `n = 0` — the P0
convention, `SpaceComplexity/ZeroSpace.lean` — and satisfies the dominance
conjunct; zero-space classes are nonempty, so this is about collapse, not
vacuity).

**Proof sketch.** The input-scan counter of
`Complexity.spaceConstructible_logSpace`, **initialized at `1`** so that after
`n` consumed symbols it holds `n + 1` (an uncorrected length counter holds `n`
and emits the wrong word — round-1 audit, finding 2); emit its bits. Space:
the counter's binary width plus fixed administrative cells fit in
`A·(n + 2) ≤ 2A·(n + 1)` visited cells; dominance is `logSpace n ≤ n + 1`
(`1 ≤ 1` at `n = 0`; a small arithmetic lemma otherwise). -/
