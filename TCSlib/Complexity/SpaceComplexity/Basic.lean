# Space-bounded computation, `SPACE`, `L`, and implicitly logspace computable functions

[AB09, Def 4.1]: a language is in `SPACE(s(n))` when some machine decides it while
visiting at most `c · s(n)` work-tape cells on every input of length `n`; `L = SPACE(log n)`
[AB09, Def 4.5]. [AB09, Def 4.16]: a function `f` is *implicitly logspace computable* when it
is polynomially bounded and the two languages "the `i`-th bit of `f(x)` is `1`" and
"`i` is a position of `f(x)`" are in `L`.

## The machine model

We reuse the campaign's machines (`Turing.FinTM Bool`) unchanged. They already have the
shape of [AB09, Fig. 4.1]:

* **the input tape is read-only**: a transition (`Turing.Action`) has no write component
  for the input tape, only a head move, clamped to the input and its two boundary blanks;
* **the output tape is write-once, append-only**: a step appends at most one symbol;
* **space is the number of work-tape cells visited** (`Turing.MultiTapeTM.spaceUsed`, the
  sum over the work tapes of the visited cells), exactly the measure of [AB09, Def 4.1]
  ("at most `c · s(n)` locations on M's work tapes (excluding the input tape) are ever
  visited by M's head").

## Main definitions

* `Turing.FinTM.ComputesInSpace` — `M` computes `f`, halting on every input, visiting at most
  `s(|x|)` work cells.
* `Turing.FinTM.DecidesInSpace` — `M` decides `L` within space `s`. [AB09, Def 4.1]
* `Complexity.SPACE` — the class of languages decidable in space `c · s(n)`. [AB09, Def 4.1]
* `Complexity.logSpace` — the logarithmic space bound `⌊log₂ n⌋ + 1`.
* `Complexity.LOGSPACE` — the class `L = SPACE(log n)`. [AB09, Def 4.5]
* `Complexity.indexLang` — the language `{⟨x, i⟩ | p x i}` with `i` in binary.
* `Complexity.ImplicitlyLogspaceComputable` — [AB09, Def 4.16].

## Main results

* `Complexity.SPACE.mono` — `SPACE` is monotone in the space bound.

## Divergences from [AB09]

* **The logarithm.** [AB09] writes `SPACE(log n)` and requires `s(n) ≥ log n` (p. 79). We use
  `logSpace n = ⌊log₂ n⌋ + 1`, which is at least `1` (so short inputs get constant space, the
  standard reading of the convention) and is `Θ(log n)` for `n ≥ 2`.
* **Pairs and indices** (Def 4.16). The pair `⟨x, i⟩` is `Turing.pairEncode x (Nat.bits i)`:
  the campaign's self-delimiting pairing with the index in little-endian binary without
  redundant zeros (`Nat.bits 0 = []`). Indices are **`0`-based**: the bit language is
  `{⟨x, i⟩ | f(x)ᵢ = 1}` with `f(x)ᵢ` the `i`-th bit from `0`, and the length language is
  `{⟨x, i⟩ | i < |f(x)|}` where [AB09] writes `i ≤ |f(x)|` for `1`-based `i`.
* **Polynomial bound** (Def 4.16). [AB09] asks `|f(x)| ≤ |x|^c`; at `x = ε` that forces
  `f(ε) = ε` for `c ≥ 1`. We use the campaign normal form `|f(x)| ≤ C · (|x| + 1)^c`
  (`Complexity.PolyBound` shape).
* **Halting.** Deciding (resp. computing) includes halting on every input, as in [AB09]
  ("a TM M deciding L"); the space bound is checked at the halting time, and since space is
  monotone in time and frozen after halting this is the space of the whole computation.
* **One measure for both classes.** [AB09, Def 4.1]'s own wording splits: *visited*
  work-tape locations for `SPACE` (the clause quoted above) but *nonblank* locations for
  `NSPACE`. The campaign convention is the visited-cells measure for both; the planned
  `NSPACE` (`AroraBarakChapters3-4Plan.md`, phase P4.1) counts visited cells along every
  choice word, with all branches halting.
* **Zero bounds collapse the class** (P0 reception audit, round 1, finding 1): every
  work tape's visited set contains its origin, so every machine satisfies
  `M.k ≤ spaceUsed` on every input at every time. A single length with `s n = 0`
  therefore forces a deciding machine to have **no work tapes at all** — and then it
  has zero space on *every* input — so `SPACE s = SPACE (fun _ => 0)` (semantically
  the two-way-finite-automaton class) whenever `s` has a zero; multiplicative
  absorption cannot repair this, since `c * 0 = 0`. In particular the literal
  `SPACE (fun n => n)` is **not** linear space: `n = 0` collapses it. **Campaign
  convention:** every asymptotic chapter statement uses an everywhere-positive bound —
  `fun n => n + 1`, `fun n => n ^ c + 1`, `Complexity.logSpace` — never a bound with a
  zero. The characterization and the harmless-normalization identities are the sanity
  layer `TCSlib.Complexity.SpaceComplexity.ZeroSpace`.
