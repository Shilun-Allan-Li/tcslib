# Complexity — Turing machines

The multi-tape Turing machine model underlying the Arora-Barak formalization
(see `AroraBarakChapter1Plan.md`): a machine-free configuration/action layer, the
deterministic machine with time and space semantics, the bundled finite layer over which
all complexity classes are stated, and oracle machines as a wrapper over the same
configurations.

The core model files are vendored from cslib
(https://github.com/leanprover/cslib, commit a3747758, 2026-09-14); see the file headers
for the local modifications.

## Contents

* `Configuration` — configurations `Cfg`, actions `Action` and their application; the
  space measure. Nothing here mentions a machine (vendored).
* `Deterministic` — `MultiTapeTM`, the step/run semantics, time and space bounds
  (vendored).
* `Finite` — the bundled `FinTM` layer carrying `Fintype`/`DecidableEq` state instances;
  all headline definitions are stated over it.
* `Oracle` — oracle machines `OracleTM` [AB09, §3.4]: same configurations, oracle-dependent
  step; the embedding of plain machines and its oracle-independence sanity theorems.
