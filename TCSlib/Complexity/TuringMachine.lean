# Complexity — Turing machines

The multi-tape Turing machine model underlying the Arora-Barak formalization
(see `AroraBarakChapter1Plan.md`): a machine-free configuration/action layer, the
deterministic machine with time and space semantics, the bundled finite layer over which
all complexity classes are stated, and oracle machines as a wrapper over the same
configurations.

The core model files are vendored from cslib
(https://github.com/leanprover/cslib, commit a3747758, 2026-09-14); see the file headers
for the local modifications.

## Contents

* `Configuration` — configurations `Cfg`, actions `Action` and their application; the
  space measure. Nothing here mentions a machine (vendored).
* `Deterministic` — `MultiTapeTM`, the step/run semantics, time and space bounds
  (vendored).
* `Finite` — the bundled `FinTM` layer carrying `Fintype`/`DecidableEq` state instances;
  all headline definitions are stated over it.
* `Oracle` — oracle machines `OracleTM` [AB09, §3.4]: same configurations, oracle-dependent
  step; the embedding of plain machines and its oracle-independence sanity theorems.
* `Composition` — identity/constant machines and closure of time-bounded computability
  under composition; also the formal home of the append-only-output convention
  argument.
* `Robustness/AlphabetReduction` — binary alphabet suffices [AB09, Claim 1.5].
* `Robustness/SingleTape` — one work tape suffices, quadratically [AB09, Claim 1.6].
* `Robustness/Bidirectional` — unidirectional tape use suffices [AB09, Claim 1.8].
* `Robustness/Oblivious` — oblivious machines and the quadratic oblivious simulation
  [AB09, Remark 1.7, Exercise 1.5] (imports the `ClassP` definitions it needs).
* `Encoding` — machines as strings [AB09, §1.4]: the code normal form `CodeTM`, the
  fixed canonical serialization, the representation-scheme laws `MachineCode`, and
  the effective scheme `EffectiveMachineCode` that the universal machine requires.
* `Universal` — the universal machine [AB09, Theorem 1.9]: the all-string evaluator
  with linear overhead and divergence preservation, the relaxed quadratic
  total-function form, and the time-bounded variant (code-first input layout).
