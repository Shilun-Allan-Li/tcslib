# The exhaustive replay of a fixed NDTM

[AB09, §3.2, proof of Theorem 3.2]: the complement of a nondeterministic language is decidable
deterministically in exponential time "by examining all the possibilities for the machine's
nondeterministic choices", and that simulation suffices for the nondeterministic time
hierarchy. `Turing.FinNDTM.exists_exhaustiveDecider` is that simulation
for a fixed NDTM, as a public generic theorem (user decision 2 of 2026-10-13): on every input on
which all branches halt within `T`, a deterministic machine decides acceptance within
`C·2^{C·(T + 1)}`, with no input-length term. The exponential decider of the hierarchy is then
`BF := E(UN)`, the exhaustive replay of the universal NDTM; its statement is derived here
(`Turing.ndAcceptsWithin_decider_of_universal`, proved).

## Main definitions

No new definitions: the exhaustive replay and `BF` are existential contracts.

## Main results

* `Turing.FinNDTM.exists_exhaustiveDecider` — the exhaustive replay `E` (sorried).
* `Turing.ndAcceptsWithin_decider_of_universal` — `BF := E(UN)` (proved).

/-- **The exhaustive replay `E`.** For every bundled binary NDTM `N` there is a deterministic
machine `E` and a constant `C` such that, on every input `z` on which every branch of `N` of
length `T` has halted (any `T`, which nobody needs to compute), `E` outputs `[true]` if `N`
accepts `z` within `T`, and `[false]` otherwise, in either case within `C·2^{C·(T + 1)}` steps.
There is no `|z|` term. [AB09, §3.2, proof of Theorem 3.2: the trivial exponential simulation
of a nondeterministic machine]

**Proof sketch.** Iterative deepening. For `L = 0, 1, …`: enumerate the `2^L` words of length
`L` on a counter tape (`Turing.incrementTM`); replay each through `N.tm.replayTM` for `L` steps
under the step-clocked runner (`Turing.exists_stepClockTMVia`, gated with the B6 hosts),
silently (`Turing.embedSilentTM`); record whether some branch accepted (halted with output
`[true]`) and whether some branch is still live; between replays clear the work tapes within
radius `L` (a counter-driven window clear) and rewind the native input head. Stop at the first
`L` at which every branch has halted; it is at most `T`, and acceptance within `L` and within
`T` agree there (`Turing.FinNDTM.AcceptsWithin.mono` one way; the other by truncating an
accepting word of length `T` at `L`, `Turing.NDTM.runWith_of_halt`). Answer accordingly. Each
replay touches at most `L + 1` input cells, so there is no `|z|` term. Ledger:
`Σ_{L ≤ T} 2^L·O_N(L + 1) ≤ C·2^{C·(T + 1)}`. -/

/-- **The exponential decider from the universal NDTM**, `BF := E(UN)`: if `UN` is a timed
universal NDTM for the scheme `c` (the statement of `Turing.exists_timed_universal_NDTM`), then
there is a deterministic machine `BF` such that for every code `α` there is a constant `C` with
`BF` outputting `[true]` or `[false]` on `⟨⟨bits t, α⟩, x⟩`, according to whether the coded
machine accepts `x` within `t`, within `C·2^{C·(t + 1)}` steps (the statement of
`Turing.exists_ndAcceptsWithin_decider`). [AB09, §3.2, proof of Theorem 3.2, step 2]

**Proof sketch.** `BF` is the exhaustive replay of `UN`
(`Turing.FinNDTM.exists_exhaustiveDecider`) with constant `C_E`. Every branch of `UN` halts
within `C_α·(t + 1)`, so `E` decides `UN`'s acceptance within that bound, which is the coded
machine's acceptance within `t`, in time `C_E·2^{C_E·(C_α·(t + 1) + 1)}`; with
`C := C_E·(C_α + 1)` this is at most `C·2^{C·(t + 1)}`. -/
