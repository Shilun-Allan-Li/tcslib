# Nondeterministic deciding and the classes NTIME

[AB09, §2.1.2, Definition 2.5]: a language `L` is in `NTIME T` when some binary-choice
NDTM decides it within time `c · T` — on every input, **every** branch halts within the
budget, and the input is in `L` exactly when **some** branch accepts. This module fixes
the binary alphabet (as `TCSlib.Complexity.ClassP.DTIME` does for the deterministic
classes), defines acceptance, the deciding predicate, and `NTIME`, and states the
deterministic embedding `DTIME ⊆ NTIME`.

## Design and deviations from [AB09]

* **Acceptance is by output, not by a `q_accept` state**: a branch *accepts* when it has
  halted with output exactly `[true]`. [AB09] gives NDTMs a distinguished accepting
  state; our machine model (single halting state, append-only output tape)
  distinguishes outcomes by output, and the deterministic `Turing.FinTM.DecidesInTime`
  already reads `[true]`/`[false]` off the output tape — acceptance-by-output keeps the
  two layers aligned, at the price that a branch halting with output `[]`, `[false]`,
  or any string other than the singleton `[true]` is non-accepting. Nothing constrains
  the outputs of non-accepting branches. **Design question (a) for the phase-2
  audit.**
* **The totality bound quantifies over all inputs and all branches**
  ([AB09, §2.1.2] verbatim: "for every input `x` and every sequence of nondeterministic
  choices"): `Turing.FinNDTM.DecidesInTime` demands `HaltsWithin` on **every** input —
  members and non-members alike — conjoined per input with the acceptance equivalence.
  Placing the halting quantifier per input (rather than as one global conjunct) is
  presentational; demanding it on non-members is not, and is the standard reading.
  **Design question (b) for the phase-2 audit.**
* **Exact-length choice words**: both `AcceptsWithin` and `HaltsWithin` quantify over
  choice words of length exactly `t`. Halting is absorbing under every choice
  (`Turing.NDTM.runWith_of_halt`), so exact-length and bounded-length quantifiers agree;
  the monotonicity lemmas below are the precise form of that remark.
* As with `Complexity.DTIME`, the constant `c` in `NTIME` ranges over all of `ℕ`; the
  value `c = 0` gives the unsatisfiable budget `0` (no machine is halted at time `0`)
  and contributes nothing, matching [AB09]'s `c > 0` without a positivity side
  condition.

## Main definitions

* `Turing.FinNDTM.AcceptsWithin` — some branch of length `t` halts with output
  `[true]`. [AB09, §2.1.2: "`M(x) = 1`"]
* `Turing.FinNDTM.DecidesInTime` — all-branch halting plus the acceptance
  characterization of membership. [AB09, §2.1.2]
* `Complexity.NTIME` — the class of languages decided nondeterministically in time
  `c · T`. [AB09, Definition 2.5]

## Main results

* `Turing.FinNDTM.AcceptsWithin.mono` — acceptance is monotone in the branch length.
* `Complexity.NTIME.mono` — `NTIME` is monotone in the time bound.
* `Complexity.DTIME_subset_NTIME` — deterministic time is nondeterministic time.
  [AB09, §2.1.2]
* `Complexity.NTIME_eq_empty_of_exists_zero` — a vanishing time bound gives the empty
  class, as for `DTIME`.

/-- The machine `N` *accepts* `x` within `t` steps: **some** choice word of length `t`
leaves the machine halted with output exactly `[true]`. This is [AB09, §2.1.2]'s
"`M(x) = 1`" with acceptance read off the output tape in place of the `q_accept` state
(see the deviations list; design question (a)). A branch halted with any other output —
including `[]` and `[false]` — is non-accepting. -/

    (N.tm.runWith w (N.tm.initCfg x)).output = [true]

/-- Acceptance is monotone in the branch length: an accepting branch stays accepting
when the choice word is extended.

**Proof sketch.** Pad the accepting word `w` to `w ++ List.replicate (t' - t) false`
(length `t'` by `List.length_append` and `List.length_replicate`, since `t ≤ t'`);
`Turing.NDTM.runWith_append` factors the padded run through the halted configuration
reached by `w`, and `Turing.NDTM.runWith_of_halt` absorbs the padding, preserving both
the halted state and the output `[true]`. -/

non-members alike), and `x ∈ L` exactly when some such branch accepts.

/-- The class of languages decidable nondeterministically in time `c · T` for some
constant `c`: a language `L` is in `NTIME T` iff some finite binary-alphabet NDTM
decides it within `c · T n` steps on inputs of length `n`, in the sense of
`Turing.FinNDTM.DecidesInTime`. [AB09, Definition 2.5] -/

/-- `NTIME` is monotone in the time bound.

**Proof sketch.** The same machine works at the larger budget `c · T₂ n ≥ c · T₁ n`.
All-branch halting transfers by `Turing.NDTM.HaltsWithin.mono`. The acceptance
equivalence transfers in both directions: forward by
`Turing.FinNDTM.AcceptsWithin.mono` (pad the accepting word); backward by truncation —
given an accepting word `w` at the larger budget, its prefix `w.take (c * T₁ n)` has
halted (all-branch halting at the smaller budget), and `Turing.NDTM.runWith_append` on
`w = w.take _ ++ w.drop _` with `Turing.NDTM.runWith_of_halt` shows the full run equals
the truncated one, so the truncated word already accepts. -/

/-- **Deterministic time is nondeterministic time** [AB09, §2.1.2]: a TM is an NDTM
that ignores its choices, so `DTIME T ⊆ NTIME T`.

**Proof sketch.** Given `M` deciding `L` within `c · T n`, take
`Turing.FinTM.toFinNDTM M`. By `Turing.MultiTapeTM.toNDTM_runWith`, the run under
**any** choice word of length `t` is `M`'s deterministic run to time `t`, so: every
branch of length `c · T n` is halted because `M`'s computation has halted by then
(`Turing.FinTM.DecidesInTime` unfolded through `Turing.FinTM.computesInTime_iff`),
giving `HaltsWithin`; and some branch of that length is halted with output `[true]` iff
`M`'s output at that time is `[true]`, which by the indicator contract
(`Turing.MultiTapeTM.indicator`) holds iff `x ∈ L` — for `x ∉ L` the output is
`[false] ≠ [true]` on every branch, so no branch accepts. -/
theorem DTIME_subset_NTIME (T : ℕ → ℕ) : DTIME T ⊆ NTIME T := by

/-- If the time bound vanishes at even one input length, the class is empty, exactly as
for `Complexity.DTIME_eq_empty_of_exists_zero`: the initial configuration is not
halted, so all-branch halting already fails at budget `c * 0 = 0`.

**Proof sketch.** Given `T n = 0` and a claimed decider, instantiate
`Turing.FinNDTM.DecidesInTime` at the input `List.replicate n false`
(`List.length_replicate`); its `HaltsWithin` conjunct applied to the empty choice word
(`Turing.NDTM.runWith_nil`) asserts that the initial configuration is halted,
contradicting `Turing.Cfg.init`'s state `some q₀`. -/
