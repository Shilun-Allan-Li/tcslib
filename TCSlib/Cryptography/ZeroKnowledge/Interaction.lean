# Interactive protocols: strategies, executions, views

The interaction model of [PS10, §4.4] in the form frozen by the campaign's foundation
decision D8 (`briefs/pass-shelat/DESIGN.md` §2.15). An interactive machine is a *next-message
strategy* `next x z r received`: given the common input `x`, the auxiliary input `z`, the
random tape `r` and the messages received so far, it returns the next message to send; its
value on the complete history is the party's output. A protocol is a pair of strategies with
an explicit polynomial number of messages (`rounds : PolyExpr`) and a first mover. The
execution `A_{r₁}(x, z₁) ↔ B_{r₂}(x, z₂)` is the fixed alternation of `rounds.eval |x|` moves
(`exec`), and the four derived objects of the text — the view of each party, the transcript,
and the outputs — are projections of it.

**Deviation (D8, recorded once here for the whole chapter):** no tapes, states or idle
transitions are modelled; "entering the idle state" is returning from `next`; the number of
messages is fixed by the protocol (a party that would halt is modelled as sending `[]`), and the
verifier's verdict is `V.next` on the complete history, so it is always defined. The text's
"a round ends when the active machine halts — in which case the protocol ends" makes the
literal `Pr[out_V = 0]` of [PS10, Definition 116.1] unsatisfiable against a prover that halts
at once; the fixed-alternation reading is the one under which that clause is satisfiable.
Verdict convention (run-3 audit P9-3): when the verifier is the last mover, the verdict
activation has exactly the arguments of the activation that produced its last message, so its
last message *is* its verdict (`Protocol.outV_eq_getLast_of_moverIsV`); the chapter's protocols
are stated with the prover moving last, and the `n`-fold protocols read the verifier's last
message as the verdict.
`Strategy.Efficient` ([PS10, §4.4], time complexity of an interactive machine) is one
activation of a uniform `Complexity.NUPPT` at parameter `|x|` on `⟨⟨x, z⟩, messages⟩` with the
whole random tape; the time is polynomial in the total input length rather than in `|x|`
alone (the text's `t(|x|)` "regardless of messages" would leave the simulator's call to `V*`
on long auxiliary inputs ill-defined; see D8). Consequently `Efficient` alone does not bound a
party's work in `|x|` against a counterparty that sends long messages; the message-prefix cap
`Strategy.ReadsPrefix m` — the strategy depends only on the first `m(|x|)` bits of each received
message, as a time-`t(|x|)` machine of the text necessarily does — restores the text's bound,
and the class `IP` (`InteractiveProofs.lean`) requires it of the verifier (run-3 audit P9-1).

## Main definitions

* `TCSlib.Cryptography.Strategy` — a next-message strategy with an explicit coin polynomial
  [PS10, §4.4] (Def-114.a); `Strategy.ofNUPPT`, `Strategy.Efficient` (Def-116.b, the machine
  half), `Strategy.ReadsPrefix` (Def-116.b, the message-prefix cap of the text's bound in `|x|`).
* `TCSlib.Cryptography.exec` — the messages received by each party after `k` moves
  [PS10, §4.4] (Def-115.a).
* `TCSlib.Cryptography.View`, `TCSlib.Cryptography.View.encode` — a party's view
  `(x, z, r, received)` and its string encoding (Def-115.b).
* `TCSlib.Cryptography.Protocol` — two strategies, the number of messages and the first mover
  (Def-114.b); `Protocol.transcriptWith`, `Protocol.transcript` (Def-115.c), `Protocol.outV`,
  `Protocol.outP`, `Strategy.out` (Def-115.d), `Protocol.viewV`, `Protocol.viewP`,
  `Protocol.execution` (Def-115.a/b), `Protocol.withV`.

## Main results

* `TCSlib.Cryptography.exec_length` — after `k` moves exactly `k` messages have been sent.
* `TCSlib.Cryptography.Strategy.ofNUPPT_efficient` — every uniform machine is an efficient
  strategy (non-vacuity of Def-116.b).
* `TCSlib.Cryptography.Strategy.ReadsPrefix.mono`,
  `TCSlib.Cryptography.Strategy.ReadsPrefix.next_congr` — the message-prefix cap is monotone
  in the cap and makes the next message a function of the truncated history.
* `TCSlib.Cryptography.Protocol.outV_eq_getLast_of_moverIsV` — when the verifier is the last
  mover, its last message is its verdict (the verdict convention of D8).
* `TCSlib.Cryptography.Protocol.uprob_outV_eq_uexp`,
  `TCSlib.Cryptography.Protocol.exists_proverCoins_le` — random executions are samplers on the
  product of the two coin spaces (Def-116.a), and a prover's coins may be fixed without
  decreasing any event's probability (the "without loss of generality deterministic `P*`"
  remark of the soundness clause).

/-- A next-message strategy [PS10, §4.4] (Def-114.a): `next x z r received` is the message a
party sends on common input `x`, auxiliary input `z` and random tape `r` after having
*received* the listed messages; on the complete history its value is the party's output. The
random tape has the explicit polynomial length `coins.eval |x|`.

**Deviation (D8):** no tapes, states or idle transitions; the output function of the text is
the next-message function on the complete history. -/

/-- A PPT strategy [PS10, §4.4, time complexity of an interactive machine] (Def-116.b): the
next-message function is computed by a uniform `NUPPT` with the same coin polynomial, one
activation per message at parameter `|x|` on `⟨⟨x, z⟩, messages⟩` with the whole random tape.

**Deviation (D8):** per-activation time polynomial in the total input length `|x| + |z| +
|messages|` instead of the text's `t(|x|)` "regardless of the messages". The number of
activations is bounded by the protocol's `rounds`, but the messages of an unbounded
counterparty may be arbitrarily long, so `Efficient` alone does not bound a party's work in
`|x|` (run-3 audit P9-1). The text's bound is recovered by adding the message-prefix cap
`ReadsPrefix m`: an efficient strategy that reads only `m(|x|)` bits of each message runs in
time polynomial in `|x| + |z|`, and the class `IP` requires the cap of the verifier. -/

/-- A strategy reads at most an `m(|x|)`-bit prefix of each received message [PS10, §4.4, time
complexity: an interactive machine of time complexity `t(|x|)` reads at most `t(|x|)` cells of
its communication tape per activation, "independently of the content of the messages it
receives"] (Def-116.b, the message half of the text's bound in `|x|`): the next-message
function is unchanged when every received message is truncated to its first `m.eval |x|` bits.
Together with `Efficient` this is the text's PPT interactive machine — the activation is
computed in time polynomial in `|x| + |z| + rounds · m(|x|)` by truncating the messages first —
whereas `Efficient` alone is polynomial in the total message length (D8).

/-! ### Protocols -/

/-- A protocol [PS10, §4.4] (Def-114.b): a prover strategy, a verifier strategy, the number of
messages exchanged (an explicit polynomial in `|x|`) and the first mover (`true` = verifier
first, as in the graph non-isomorphism protocol; `false` = prover first, as in the graph
isomorphism and 3-colouring protocols). The verifier's verdict is its next-message function
on the complete history.

**Deviation (D8):** fixed number of messages `rounds.eval |x|`; a halting party sends `[]`.
If the verifier is the last mover (prover first with an even number of messages, or verifier
first with an odd number), its last message coincides with its verdict — both are `V.next` on
the same history (`outV_eq_getLast_of_moverIsV`) — so a verifier whose final message differs
from its verdict is not expressible; protocols are therefore stated so that the prover moves
last, or the verifier's last message is read as the verdict (the `n`-fold protocols)
(run-3 audit P9-3). -/
