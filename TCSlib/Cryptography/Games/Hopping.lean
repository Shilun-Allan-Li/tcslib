# Game hopping

The steps of a game-based security proof, proved once:
- **the difference lemma**: two events that agree unless a "bad" event happens differ in
  probability by at most the probability of the bad event;
- **identical until bad**: two oracle implementations that answer identically until a flag in
  their state is raised, and never lower it, give simulations whose outputs differ in probability
  by at most the probability that the flag is raised;
- **a collision bound**: a fresh uniform sample lands in a list of at most `q` earlier values with
  probability at most `q / |T|`. This is the "bad event" of most PRF-based proofs, for example a
  repeated nonce in [PS10, Thm 168.2].

The hybrid argument itself is `distAdv_hybrid` (`TCSlib.Cryptography.Games.Advantage`).

/-- **Identical until bad** (the code-based fundamental lemma): let two implementations of the
same oracles agree on every query made from a state where `bad` fails, and let each keep `bad`
once it holds (every possible new state of a bad state is bad). Then, from a good state, for any
computation `c` and event `p` on its output, the probabilities of `p` under the two simulations
differ by at most the probability that the first simulation ends in a bad state.
[BR06, Lemma 2], [Sho04, §4]

**Proof sketch.**
1. *Sticky:* from a bad state, every possible final state of either simulation is bad
   (induction on `c`, from the hypothesis on each implementation).
2. *Equal until bad:* from a good state, the two simulations give the same probability to
   "`p` holds and the final state is good", and the same probability to "the final state is bad".
   Induction on `c`: at a query from a good state both implementations are the same computation;
   for each of its outputs, a good new state is the induction hypothesis, and a bad new state
   makes "good at the end" impossible and "bad at the end" certain on both sides (step 1,
   `prob_eq_zero_of_allOutputs`, `prob_eq_one_of_allOutputs`).
3. Write each probability of `p` as "`p` and good" plus at most "bad", and conclude with the
   difference lemma's arithmetic. -/
