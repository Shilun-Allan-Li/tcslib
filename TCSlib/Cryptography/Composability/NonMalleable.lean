# Non-malleable encryption (statement phase)

[PS10, Definition 172.6] and Theorem 175.9, over the public-key experiment of Definition 171.5
(`Composability/PublicKey.lean`).

**The experiment** `NM_b(Π, A, n)`: `(pk, sk) ← Gen(1^n)`; `(m₀, m₁, state) ← A^{O₁}(1^n, pk)`;
`c ← Enc_pk(m_b)`; `(c'₁, …, c'_ℓ) ← A^{O₂}(c, state)`; output `(m'₁, …, m'_ℓ)` with
`m'_i = ⊥` if `c'_i = c` and `m'_i = Dec_sk(c'_i)` otherwise. The scheme is non-malleable when,
for every adversary `A` and distinguisher `D`, `D` tells `NM_0` from `NM_1` with negligible
advantage.

**Its encoding.** The oracles and the phases are those of Definition 171.5 (`indImpl`). The
adversary's final output is `ℓ(n)` ciphertexts of `ctLen(n)` bits. Each decryption is encoded as
`Dec`'s oracle answers are (`decAnswer`): a validity flag and the message, all-`false` for `⊥`.
`D` receives their concatenation.

**Source notes.**
- The definition writes private-key notation (`k ← Gen(1^n)`, `Dec_k`) for a public-key scheme;
  the public-key reading is taken (inventory Def-172.6).
- The source leaves the oracles `O₁, O₂` open; they are parametrized by the attack, as in
  Definition 171.5. Theorem 175.9's "CCA2 non-malleability" is the CCA2 instance.
- The adversary chooses `m₀, m₁`, so the definition's closing "for all `m₀, m₁ ∈ {0,1}^n`" is
  dropped. At CPA this is [PSV06, Definition 3], by the source's authors (ruling of 2026-11-05):
  the adversary picks `m₀, m₁` after seeing `pk`, `D` sees only the decryptions, and a copy of
  the challenge and an invalid ciphertext both decrypt to `⊥`. [PSV07, Definition 3] (IND-NME′)
  is its many-message form.
- Definition 173.7 and Theorem 174.8 follow [PSV07] (same ruling), in
  `Composability/SimNonMalleable.lean`.

/-- **Theorem 175.9: under CCA2, secrecy and non-malleability coincide** [PS10, Theorem 175.9].

**Proof sketch** (the source's, made explicit).
1. (⇒) Given an NM adversary `A` with `ℓ` ciphertexts and a distinguisher `D`, the IND
   adversary runs `A`, then asks CCA2's `Dec` for each of `A`'s ciphertexts. `Dec` refuses the
   challenge with the same `⊥` that `NM` assigns to its copies (`indImpl_dec_cca2_challenge`,
   `nmDecrypt_challenge`), so the answers are exactly `NM_b`'s output. It runs `D` on them and
   outputs `D`'s verdict. Same advantage, with budget `q + ℓ`; `D` is run by T1's handler.
2. (⇐) Given an IND adversary `A` with guess `g`, the NM adversary runs `A` and outputs fresh
   encryptions of `g^{msgLen}` and `(¬g)^{msgLen}` (it holds `pk`). The two plaintexts differ, so
   by correctness at most one of the two ciphertexts is the challenge. The distinguisher reads
   `g` from the first if it decrypts, and from the second otherwise. Same advantage; at
   `msgLen(n) = 0` there is nothing to distinguish.

The source's sketch argues the contrapositives: an NM break yields a related ciphertext that
`Dec` decrypts, and an IND break lets the adversary decrypt and re-encrypt a related message. -/
