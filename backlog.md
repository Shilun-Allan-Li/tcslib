# Backlog

The consolidated tracking file for the Arora-Barak campaign branch
(`complexity/arora-barak-ch1`) and adjacent repository work: human-review
design questions, queued and on-hold campaign work, deferred formalizations,
pending decisions, and housekeeping. Consolidated 2026-09-18 from the two
campaign plans, the audit resolutions records, and session assessments.

**Conventions.** This file is the *canonical home* of the human-review
question statements (§1) — the plans keep stable numbered stubs, since audit
documents cite the numbering — and the *tracking index* for everything else
(scope prose remains in the plans; decision-log history is never moved).
New items land here; an item leaves only by a decision recorded in the
relevant plan's decision log. From the next audit round onward this file
joins the bundle attachment set.

## 1. Human-review design questions (reserved — never closed by an automated gate)

Flagged for a **human** auditor/maintainer: the LLM audit rounds verify
correctness, but these are matters of architectural taste and trust-surface
policy.

### CH1-Q1 — the 3A Mathlib-computability bridge

*Origin: `AroraBarakChapter1Plan.md` §5 (epoch 3, batch A);
`MathlibBridge.lean`, `Turing.exists_effectiveMachineCode`.*

The audited docstring sketch called for the canonizer machine to be
**hand-assembled from this repository's composition combinators** ("its
construction uses the composition combinators", optionally with a polynomial
`canonizerTime`). The delivered proof instead (i) proves the canonization
*function* primitive recursive, (ii) compiles it through **Mathlib's verified
recursion-theory pipeline** (`ToPartrec.Code.exists_code` →
`PartrecToTM2.tr_eval`), (iii) simulates the resulting TM2 stack machine in
our model with a bespoke private `bridgeTM`, and (iv) lands in the binary
alphabet via the proved `alphabet_reduction`, extracting the time bound by
finite maxima (no polynomial bound claimed — permitted, since
`canonizerTime` is existential). The batch flagged the deviation itself; the
maintainer verification pass confirmed the proof is sorry-free with the
standard axiom footprint and zero public-interface drift. **Open questions
for a human:** (a) is the heavyweight `Mathlib.Computability.TMToPartrec`
import into the TM tree acceptable, or should the bridge be quarantined
behind the planned phase-5 `MathlibBridge` module boundary (it effectively
front-runs that module)? (b) is the enlarged trust/review surface (Mathlib's
TM2 semantics + the private `bridgeTM` simulation, ~150 private
declarations) preferable to a longer but self-contained combinator
construction? (c) should the abandoned polynomial-`canonizerTime` claim be
recorded as permanently out of scope, or re-derived later from the
combinator route if one is ever written? Since the epoch-3→4 merge the
bridge lives in the dedicated `MathlibBridge.lean`, which implements the
quarantine that part (a) contemplates — the `TMToPartrec` import is confined
to that one module and nothing outside `exists_effectiveMachineCode` depends
on it — but the implemented quarantine does **not** dispose of this
question: parts (a)-(c) remain open for human review (epoch-4 audit,
finding 3: an earlier version of this text misplaced the bridge inside
`Encoding.lean`).

*Cross-link: part (c) gained relevance in Chapter 2 — see §3, "Polynomial
canonizer for a concrete scheme".*

### CH1-Q2 — the 3B universal-interpreter proof architecture

*Origin: `AroraBarakChapter1Plan.md` §5 (epoch 3, batches B + B2);
`Universal.lean`, `Turing.universal`.*

The proof followed the audited sketch's outline (prefix-only startup,
canonizer capture onto a table tape, four-work-tape interpreter with a fixed
finite controller), but the realized architecture is by far the campaign's
most involved artifact: 2465 lines (2831 after the epoch-4A timed fill), 104
private declarations built across two agent sessions (WIP `f191b918` +
continuation), a bespoke checkpoint relation (`universalRelation`) with
generic block-simulation assembly (`universal_block_run` /
`universal_from_blocks`), a virtual left boundary via a marker tape, a unary
state tape with group-wise table scanning, and an *exact* per-phase cost
ledger realized to `universalBlockBound = 3L + 5N + 20`. The kernel checks
all of it, and the public statement is frozen and audited — but the *design*
was never itself an audit deliverable at this level of detail. **Open
questions for a human:** (a) is this the right load-bearing shape — and
which parts (the capture wrapper, the block-run/`universal_run_join`
assembly, the marker-directed rewind and unary-copy gadget patterns, all
flagged by the agents as promotion candidates) should graduate to shared
modules rather than being re-derived? (b) is the exact-ledger posture
(`3L + 5N + 20` proved to the transition) worth its brittleness against any
future change to `CodeTM.serialize`, or should the maintained invariant be
an existential bound with the exact ledger demoted to documentation? (c)
does the interpreter's claim to *be* the book's universal machine (as
opposed to satisfying the frozen statement, which the kernel settles)
deserve a targeted human read of the construction's core definitions
(`UniversalControl`, `universalInterpreter`, `universalRelation`), given no
executable diagnostics of the whole interpreter ever ran (the batch-B smoke
tests aborted on deep recursion and were discarded)?

*Cross-link: question (b)'s exact ledger is now also load-bearing for the
Chapter-2 `TMSAT_mem_NP` fill (the quantitative public bridge, §2), which
will expose a form of the constant publicly.*

### CH2-Q1 — generality of `HALT_not_mem_NP`

*Origin: `AroraBarakChapter2Plan.md` (phase-1, round-2 audit, finding 3);
`ClassNP/Reductions.lean`.*

The statement is currently at `Turing.EffectiveMachineCode` generality
because its proof route reuses Chapter 1's `HALT_not_computable`, whose own
proof runs the universal evaluator. The round-2 auditor showed this
restriction is **not mathematically necessary**: a direct diagonalization —
the public diagonal-pairing machine, the searcher's finite-control transform
with the halt/loop roles swapped, `Turing.exists_codeTM`, no evaluator —
proves `HALT` undecidable for *every* lawful `Turing.MachineCode` (and the
earlier "trivial-machine scheme" counterexample is unlawful: constant
decoding violates `decode_encode`). **The question:** add that diagonal
lemma as a new audited statement (a strengthening of Chapter 1's
uncomputability story that shares its main fill obligation, the
control-transform lemma, with `HALT_NPHard`) and generalize
`HALT_not_mem_NP` to `MachineCode` — or keep the conservative signature as a
documented API/proof-route restriction? Maintainer's provisional choice,
pending review: the conservative signature, with the docstring stating the
restriction honestly; the diagonal lemma is deliberately *not* slipped into
a repair round, since it would enlarge the audited surface of Chapter 1's
uncomputability chapter.

## 2. Campaign work queued or on hold

* **Chapter-2 fill campaign (E1-E5)** — **on hold** (user decision,
  2026-09-18, pending the Chapter-6 integration question, §4). All four
  statement-phase gates are closed; 59 audited-true admissions await fills.
  Epoch order per `AroraBarakChapter2Plan.md` §4: (E1) assemblies +
  poly-calculus core, (E2) NDTM compilations + `NP ⊆ EXP` enumerator +
  padding + `TMSAT`, (E3) `SAT ≤ₚ 3SAT` machine + tableau mathematics, (E4)
  the Cook-Levin emitter (the summit), (E5) closure. First deliverable when
  resumed: the epoch/batch partition with points and file ownership, then
  the E1 briefs.
* **Audit-mandated fill-brief inheritances** (each brief must carry these
  verbatim from the cited records):
  - `NP_subset_EXP` enumerator: the contract-by-contract table —
    `audits/ch2-phase1-round3-findings.md` (via `…-resolutions.md`).
  - NTIME/Theorem-2.6 compilations: the simulator invariant tables and
    branch-correspondence contracts — `audits/ch2-phase2-findings.md`
    (note 3: no untimed composition or bare computability substitutions).
  - `TMSAT_mem_NP`: the `PolyBound` budget chain and the **new public
    quantitative bridge** for `timed_universal`'s constant — one simulator
    chosen before code and input, both success and timeout clauses, the
    suggested form `(3|α| + 14·canonizerTime(|α|) + 50)·(t+1)²` avoiding a
    `PolyBound` import into Chapter 1; Chapter-1 surface growth via the
    shared-file mechanism, flagged for its own audit —
    `audits/ch2-phase3-{findings,reaudit-findings,resolutions}.md`.
  - `TMSAT_NPHard`: exact-value emission case table and the explicit `T'`
    deadline formula (never majorize the certificate length) — same records.
  - Cook-Levin emitter (E4): the six-stage output-silence contract **and**
    the round-2 boundary-check table, the product snapshot encoding, and the
    exact serialization-length ledger (never constant-per-clause) —
    `audits/ch2-phase4-{findings,reaudit-findings,resolutions}.md`.
  - Locality fills: strict `s < t` in `prevVisit`; keep no-write and
    write-blank distinct (`some none` erases); writes on the halting
    transition count — phase-4 Derivation A.
  - `TAUTOLOGY_mem_coNP`: the DNF evaluation-congruence bridge as a private
    lemma — phase-4 round 1, note 6.
* **Chapter-2 blueprint increment** — at campaign closure (E5), per the
  Chapter-1 precedent (dep-graph merge, writer agents, validator).

---

## 3. Deferred formalizations

### Chapter 1

* **Phase 5 (deliberately unscheduled; "a task for much later"):** the
  `O(T log T)` oblivious simulation ([AB09] §1.7 / Ex 1.6); the RAM-TM
  exercise (Ex 1.9); a fuller mathlib recursion-theory bridge beyond the
  `MathlibBridge` quarantine. *Origin: ch1 plan §5, decision of 2026-09-16.*
* **Waived model bridges** — revisit only if a downstream result ever needs
  a formal bridge: the append-only-output and start-marker-initialization
  conventions vs. [AB09]'s model (no read-write-output machine is
  formalized; no exact [AB09] step count is ever imported). *Origin: ch1
  plan §5 phase-2 notes; ch1 phase-2 audit findings 3/13.*
* **`Universal.lean` factoring** — 2831 lines (escalation recorded at
  epoch 4A): ~1100 lines are stopped-interpreter administrative copies
  forced by per-module `match` auxiliaries; the 4A report's three
  shared-lemma generalizations are the designated future factoring. Also
  CH1-Q2(a)'s promotion candidates. *Origin: ch1 decision log, epoch-4A row.*
* **Polynomial canonizer for a concrete scheme** (CH1-Q1(c) continued):
  Chapter 2's `TMSAT_mem_NP`/`TMSAT_NPComplete` now carry the hypothesis
  `PolyBound c.canonizerTime`; a combinator-built effective scheme with a
  *proved* polynomial canonizer would discharge the hypothesis for a
  concrete scheme and reconnect Q1(c). *Origin: ch2 phase-3 audit.*
* **Blueprint planner refinement** — writers flagged planner `\uses` edges
  not present in the cited proofs (reproduced verbatim per pipeline rules).
  *Origin: ch1 decision log, blueprint-extraction row.*

### Chapters 2-3

* **§2.4 web of reductions** (`INDSET`, `0/1 IPROG`, `dHAMPATH`, exercise
  problems) — each needs a graph/arithmetic encoding surface; the legacy
  `Complexity/NPReductions/*` files may eventually be **retargeted** as the
  structure-level halves (see §5). *Origin: ch2 plan §1.*
* **§2.5 decision-versus-search** (Theorem 2.18). *Origin: ch2 plan §1.*
* **Parsimonious and Levin reductions** ([AB09] §2.3.6). *Origin: ch2 plan §1.*
* **Ex 2.6, the universal NDTM** — Chapter 3's tool. *Origin: ch2 plan §1.*
* **Ex 2.30, Berman's theorem.** *Origin: ch2 plan §1.*
* **General Boolean formulas** — `TAUTOLOGY` is deliberately stated on the
  documented DNF fragment; a general-formula carrier (AST, evaluation,
  serialization) is new work, and any future general `TAUTOLOGY` must not be
  silently identified with the fragment. *Origin: ch2 phase-3/4 audits.*
* **`MathlibBridge` poly-time upgrade** (open lever): `bridgeTM` costs O(1)
  native steps per TM2 operation, so a Mathlib `TM2ComputableInPolyTime`
  certificate would transfer; would also serve the Chapter-6 bridges below.
  *Origin: ch2 plan decision log ("revisit at phase 3" — still open).*
* **Oracle complexity classes** (Chapter 3): `Oracle.lean` has the raw model
  and both lockstep embeddings, audited; the class layer, the
  persistent-vs-auto-erased query-tape statement (polynomial overhead only —
  constant overhead provably impossible), and relativization (Baker-Gill-
  Solovay) are future Chapter-3 work. *Origin: ch1 plan §5 phase-2 notes;
  session assessment 2026-09-18.*

### Chapter 6 bridge theorems (blocked on the §4 integration decision)

The `complexity/arora-barak-ch6` branch (circuits, `P/poly` — proved,
sorry-free) and this branch are complementary; the missing ch-6 headliners
are exactly the machine-facing ones:

* **Theorem 6.6, `P ⊆ P/poly`** — their `SizeClasses.lean` defers it for
  want of "a machine model, the class `P`, and the oblivious-simulation
  theorem"; this branch supplies all three, and the phase-4 `Snapshot`
  locality layer is essentially the tableau-to-circuit core.
* **CKT-SAT `NP`-hardness** ([AB09] Thm 6.11's completeness half; their
  branch has Tseitin equisatisfiability + size bounds only).
* **Karp-Lipton** (Thm 6.19) — needs the polynomial hierarchy, a new
  surface; **Meyer's theorem** — needs this branch's `EXP`.

---

## 4. Decisions pending (user)

* **Chapter-6 integration path** (assessment of 2026-09-18): options —
  (A) merge both branches to main independently and build the §3 bridge
  theorems afterwards; (B) merge ch6 into the campaign branch now; (C)
  coordinate conventions first. Friction items to settle with the
  colleague: their `Formulas.lean` defines `Literal`/`Term`/`DNF`/`CNF` at
  the **root namespace** (policy §1 leak; future ambiguity against
  `Std.Sat.CNF`/`Std.Sat.Literal`); three CNF ecosystems would coexist
  (their width-indexed `CNF n`, legacy `NPReductions.CNFFormula V`, the
  audited `Std.Sat.CNF ℕ`) with three SAT→3SAT artifacts; `UHalt.lean`
  introduces a **second computability framework** (Mathlib `ComputablePred`
  vs. the campaign's quarantine and its own `HALT_not_computable`); their
  work is main-track, not campaign-attested (proper, but it must not
  silently enter the audited surface). Loose ends for the colleague: the
  dangling `ch6/PLAN.md` reference; `Basic.lean` at 674 lines (> 600
  target).
* **Fill-campaign start** (§2) — on hold by the same instruction.
* **Disposition of the three §1 questions** — CH1-Q1, CH1-Q2, CH2-Q1.
* **`TCSlib.Tactics` blueprint exclusion** — 92 metaprogramming-scaffolding
  declarations deliberately excluded from the dataset; user may override.
  *Origin: ch1 blueprint-extraction row.*
* **Fate of `AroraBarakChapter1Plan.md` at merge** — graduate to `docs/` vs.
  superseded by the blueprint. *Origin: ch1 decision log (final row).*

---

## 5. Repository housekeeping

* **Legacy `Complexity/NPReductions/*`**: 14 pre-existing style-lint FAILs
  (missing docstrings/References), outside the campaign surface; eventual
  fate coupled to the §3 retargeting idea. The ch6 branch adds (clean,
  additive) counting lemmas to `SATTo3SAT.lean`.
* **Dependabot**: 88 alerts on the repository default branch (2 critical,
  16 high) — repo-level, unrelated to this branch's content.
* **`AGENTS.md` / `.claude/CLAUDE.md`** partially superseded by campaign
  practice (`workflow.md` §7 records the boundary): the `lean_proof/`-based
  flow and the LeanInfoView-only verification guidance predate the gate
  script; align or annotate eventually.
* **`audits/TEMPLATE.md`** predates the evolved pack format (attestation
  evidence separation, bundle conventions); refresh before the next fresh
  campaign starts from it.
* **`HANDOFF.md`** — the have→lemma extractor campaign's own tracking
  document; deliberately *not* absorbed here.
