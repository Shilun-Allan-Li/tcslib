# Fill-agent environment addendum: starting Lean when `/proc/<pid>/exe` is unreadable

**Authorized by the user (2026-10-14) for every fill brief of the chapters 3–4 campaign.** It
applies only under the condition below. Everything else in your brief stays binding.

## The condition

Some fill hosts cannot resolve a process's own `/proc/<pid>/exe` link: `/proc/self/exe` may be
readable while `/proc/<pid>/exe` returns *Permission denied*. Lean 4.25.0 locates its own
installation through that link (`IO.appDir`, used by `Lean.getBuildDir`), so `lean --version`,
`lake exe cache get` and `scripts/lean_check_tree.sh` fail with

```text
error: failed to locate application
```

or Lake reports `could not detect the configuration of the Lake installation`.

## The authorized fallback

**Use this only if, and after,** the pinned, unmodified Lean fails with that error in your
environment. Then you may preload the following `readlink` fallback into the Lean and Lake
processes only.

- **What it does:** it answers the single failed self-path lookup with the executable's own path,
  taken from the ELF startup metadata (`AT_EXECFN`). Every other call is passed through
  unchanged.
- **What it does not do:** it changes no filesystem permission, does not bypass the sandbox, and
  changes neither Lean, the kernel, the sources nor any proof check.
- **Precedent:** earlier campaign deliveries used exactly this source, for example the
  record-table continuation 5 (`audits/wave1-fill-agent-reports/recordtable-6-REPORT.md`).

`executable-path.c` (SHA-256 `985924ad83d39e108c0a2107bab07e65cdeb88641453508ab5acda115534fba7`):

```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <dlfcn.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <limits.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/auxv.h>

/* Supply the executable's actual path from ELF startup metadata when procfs
   cannot resolve it. No filesystem, network, or proof-checking rules change. */
ssize_t readlink(const char *path, char *buf, size_t cap) {
  static ssize_t (*real_readlink)(const char *, char *, size_t);
  if (!real_readlink) real_readlink = dlsym(RTLD_NEXT, "readlink");
  ssize_t n = real_readlink(path, buf, cap);
  char own[64];
  snprintf(own, sizeof own, "/proc/%ld/exe", (long)getpid());
  if (n >= 0 || (strcmp(path, "/proc/self/exe") && strcmp(path, own))) return n;
  const char *exe = (const char *)getauxval(AT_EXECFN);
  char absolute[PATH_MAX];
  if (!exe || !realpath(exe, absolute)) return n;
  size_t len = strlen(absolute);
  if (len > cap) len = cap;
  memcpy(buf, absolute, len);
  return (ssize_t)len;
}
```

Compile and use it in your scratch directory:

```bash
cc -shared -fPIC -O2 executable-path.c -ldl -o executable-path.so
export LEAN_SYSROOT="$HOME/.elan/toolchains/leanprover--lean4---v4.25.0"   # your pinned toolchain
export LAKE_HOME="$LEAN_SYSROOT"
export LD_PRELOAD="$PWD/executable-path.so"
lean --version   # must now print the pinned version
```

## Rules

1. **Use exactly this source.** Do not write a different shim, patch the toolchain, change
   permissions or request sandbox escalation.
2. **Scope:** preload it only into the processes that run Lean or Lake (`lake exe cache get`,
   `scripts/lean_check_tree.sh`, your probes). Nothing else.
3. **Record it in `REPORT.md`:**
   - that the condition occurred;
   - the shim's SHA-256, which must match the one above;
   - the exact environment variables you set.

   Include the source under `evidence/runtime/`. **Do not ship the compiled `.so`** or any
   build products.
4. **If Lean still cannot start** with the shim, stop and report. Do not try anything further.
5. A standard host, where Lean starts normally, needs none of this. Do not preload the shim
   there.
