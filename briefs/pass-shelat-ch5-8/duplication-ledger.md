# Duplication ledger: Pass–shelat ch. 5–8

Accepted debt, each entry acknowledged by the user, with its scheduled resolution.

| ID | New declaration (where) | Existing copy (where) | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DL-1 | `TCSlib.InformationTheory.abs_probTrue_sub_le_statDist` (#183, `InformationTheory/Extractors.lean`, for `main`) | `TCSlib.Cryptography.abs_sum_sub_le_statDist` (`Foundations/Experiments.lean`, Garg's concrete layer, on `cryptography/pass-shelat-ch2-4` and `cryptography/garg-ch1-3`; not on `main`) | accepted 2026-11-04 (user) | No copy on `main` today. When the concrete layer lands on `main`, its lemma becomes a one-line corollary of #183's (a `Finset` test is the `Bool` test `(· ∈ T)`) or is removed. Gate 01 pack erratum E1. |

## Inherited with ch. 2–4 (found 2026-11-05; acknowledged 2026-11-05 by the user: clean up now)

This campaign owns ch. 2–4 since 2026-11-05 (plan, decision log). These duplicates predate it.

| ID | Copies (where) | Status | Proposed resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| DL-2 | XOR of encodings is the encoding of the Boolean sum, `zipWith xor (ofFn a) (ofFn b) = ofFn (a + b)`, stated three times: `TCSlib.Cryptography.zipWith_xor_ofFn_add` (`Asymptotic/HardCoreLoops.lean`; it was `zipWith_xor_ofFn`, renamed by the base repair to end the name clash with `Encryption.lean`'s different lemma); `TCSlib.Cryptography.zipWith_xor_ofFn_eq_add` (`Asymptotic/MultiMessage.lean`); `TCSlib.Cryptography.MultiMsg.zipWith_xor_ofFn_eq_add` (`Asymptotic/MultiMessageLemmas.lean`) | accepted; scheduled now | Keep the most upstream copy (`HardCoreLoops`) and point the other two at it, in a ch. 2–4 cleanup PR. |
| DL-3 | `pairEncode a b ≠ []`, stated four times: `GGMRed.pairEncode_ne_nil` (`Asymptotic/GGMReduction.lean`), `GI.pairEncode_ne_nil` (`ZeroKnowledge/GraphIsomorphism/Proofs.lean`), `ColMachines.pairEncode_ne_nil` (`ZeroKnowledge/ThreeColoring/Machines.lean`); and, on `main`, `Complexity.pairEncode_ne_nil` (`Complexity/SpaceComplexity/Logspace/InputAccess.lean`), the copy that made the merge's ambiguity | accepted; scheduled now | `main` is merged (#186). Remove the three local copies in favour of `Complexity.pairEncode_ne_nil`, in the same cleanup PR. |
| DL-4 | Not a copy (different carriers): the sampler-based `StatClose` (`Asymptotic/Sampling.lean`) and `main`'s `EpsClose` on `FinDist` (`InformationTheory/Extractors.lean`, #183) | accepted; scheduled now | A bridge lemma, in the same cleanup PR (user, 2026-11-05). |
| DL-5 | Not a copy (different carriers; found by the gate 02 round 2 review): `Games.guessAdv_eq_half_advantage` and `Games.accept_guessGame` (games) and the concrete layer's `predict_eq` (`Asymptotic/Ensembles.lean`, on `uprob` over seed spaces), both the identity behind [PS10, Lemma 73.8] | disclosed in the docstring (gate 02 closing commit) | Derive one from the other through bridge B2 when ch. 2–4 lands on `main`. |

## Found in the ch. 5–8 statement phase (2026-11-05)

| # | Statement | Copies | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DL-6 | The `j`-th block of `c` bits of a coin string, `(r.drop (j * c)).take c`, stated three times: `coinSlice` (`ZeroKnowledge/GraphIsomorphism.lean`, ch. 2–4), `Authentication.coinBlock` (`Authentication/Lamport.lean`, prong A), `Protocol.phaseSlice` (`Composability/SequentialZK.lean`, prong C) | found by the Lamport worker and the maintainer | Before the ch. 5–8 statement gate: one copy in a shared upstream module, with its length lemma, used by all three. |
| DL-7 | `List.ofFn (padFin ℓ w) = w` for `|w| = ℓ`: `Authentication.ofFn_padFin_of_length` (`Lamport.lean`) is the equal-length case of ch. 2–4's `ofFn_padFin_of_le` (`Asymptotic/Collections.lean`); `Composability.length_eval_of_length` (`CCA2Scheme.lean`) repeats the step inline | found by the Lamport worker | Before the ch. 5–8 statement gate: use `ofFn_padFin_of_le (le_of_eq h)`. |
| DL-8 | `SecureComputation.PRFOut ℓ₂` (prong B, `SpecialEncryptionSecurity.lean`): ch. 2–4's `PRF` with `ℓ₂(n)`-bit outputs; `PRF` is its case `ℓ₂ = n` | resolved 2026-11-05 | `prfOut_var_iff : PRFOut .var F ↔ PRF F` proved beside `PRFOut` (prong B). The ch. 2–4 layer is unchanged. |


## Found by gate 03 (2026-11-05; rulings G3-5 and R-03l-1: clean up in the gate 03 clean-up PR, after #195)

Most copies trace to helpers that are `private` in pack 03a's and 03l's files. The clean-up makes
one copy public in the most upstream file and re-points the rest.

| Id | Copies | Status | Payback |
|---|---|---|---|
| DL-9 | The coin-block bijection `blocks` (`Fin (m · c) → Bool ≃ Fin m → Fin c → Bool`) and its lemmas, copies and an inverse: `FunFamily.blocks`, `OneWayYao.blocksE`, `blocksEquiv`, `blocksEquivX`, `EnsembleLemmas.blocks`, `SoundnessRep.blocksEquiv`, and `Ensemble.blocks` (private, `Asymptotic/Ensembles.lean`, which calls itself a copy of `FunFamily.blocks`; added on gate 03a round 2, R2-4); with S2b's public duplicate `take_drop_ofFn_blocks` of `EnsembleLemmas.take_drop_ofFn_blocks` (gate 04 N4) | accepted; scheduled (G3-5) | One `FunFamily.blocks` in a low file; re-point 03h, 03i, 03k's statements, `Ensembles.lean` (03a) and S2b's copy. |
| DL-10 | `ptc_comp` (composition of polynomial-time functions in a convenient form), six private or public copies (`Closure`/`Repetition` helpers, `Universal*`, `ThreeColoring/Machines`, …) | accepted; scheduled (G3-5) | Public once in 03a's `Closure.lean`; delete the copies. |
| DL-11 | The state loop `stateFind` (private in `Repetition.lean`) and its copies `GI.stateFind`, `EncodingMachines.polyTimeComputable_stateFind`, `GGMRed.stateLoopFun`, and the variant `stateIterate` | accepted; **half done in [#203](https://github.com/Shilun-Allan-Li/tcslib/pull/203)** (`polyTimeComputable_stateFind` public, prose fixed); the copies are re-pointed in clean-up part 2 | `polyTimeComputable_stateFind` public in `Repetition.lean`; re-point; update the prose that calls it private (`StringLoops.lean:36–38`, `HardCoreLoops.lean:68`). |
| DL-12 | `abs_uexp_sub_le`, two copies (`PublicKeyLemmas` and a private one) | accepted; scheduled (G3-5) | One public copy. |
| DL-13 | `negligible_zero` (`Foundations/Negligible.lean` since G3-7a) and `negligible_const_zero` (`ZeroKnowledge/Defs.lean`) | accepted; scheduled (G3-5) | Delete `negligible_const_zero` (2 uses). |
| DL-14 | `forall_of_uprob_eq_one`, two copies | accepted; scheduled (G3-5) | One public copy. |
| DL-15 | `decodeFin_eq_some_iff`, a private copy in `Collections.lean` and a public one in `GGMReductionEval.lean` (`GGMRed.decodeFin_eq_some_iff`; making the `Collections.lean` copy public must avoid the namespace clash, gate 03b review #12c), and the new forward lemma `ofFn_of_decodeFin_eq_some` (`CollectionsHelpers.lean`, #198); S2b's private `eq_ofFn_of_decodeFin` | accepted; scheduled (G3-5) | One public `decodeFin_eq_some_iff` in `Asymptotic/Adversary.lean`; the forward lemma derived from it. |
| DL-16 | `IterateFindHost` (03l) copies 26 declarations of `main`'s private module layer in `Complexity/ClassNP/SAT.lean` (ten now public); the new host is missing from the policy's host registry (§14) | **done in [#203](https://github.com/Shilun-Allan-Li/tcslib/pull/203)**: one public host `Turing.ModuleHost` (`TuringMachine/Build/ModuleHost.lean`), consumed by `SAT.lean` and `IterateFindHost.lean`; registry row H14 | Make `SAT.lean`'s layer public on the ch. 2–4 branch and re-point `IterateFindHost`; register the host. |
| DL-17 | `StateLoop` (03l) restates five `main` lemmas, plus `tail_poly` and `xor_poly` (arrived with the `main` merge, #186) | accepted; scheduled (R-03l-1) | Use `main`'s lemmas. |
| DL-18 | `UnaryMul` (03l) privately copies `PairSplit`'s parser | **done in [#203](https://github.com/Shilun-Allan-Li/tcslib/pull/203)** (`Turing.PairParse` in `PairSplit.lean`) | Use `PairSplit`'s. |
| DL-19 | Not a copy yet: a latent name clash between `StateLoop.BlockLoop` and `main`'s `Complexity.BlockLoop` (nothing uses it) | **done in [#203](https://github.com/Shilun-Allan-Li/tcslib/pull/203)** (renamed `StateLoop.BlockMapLoop`) | Rename or merge in the same PR. |
| DL-20 | `main`'s `TuringMachine/Build/Loop.lean` keeps a private `loop_first_halt`, the same lemma as the new public `Turing.ModuleHost.first_halt` (found by #203's worker). `Loop.lean` is upstream of the host, so it cannot consume it | noted | Move `first_halt` and `live_prefix` down into `Loop.lean` (or the machine core) at the `main` landing, and have `Loop.lean` use them. |
| DL-21 | Elementary number theory that Mathlib already has (audit `mathlib-overlap-nt.md`, 2026-11-06, Mathlib pin `029db123`): 6 DUP (`QR` = `(powMonoidHom 2).range`, `crtUnits` (keep as alias, `rfl`), `coprime_of_ne` = `(Nat.coprime_primes hp hq).2`, `powOneSubgroup` = `(powMonoidHom m).ker`, `rsaPerm` ≈ `powCoprime` (optional), `IsGenerator` ≈ `∀ x, x ∈ zpowers g`) and 9 WRAP (shorter proofs from Mathlib: `units_val_mem`, `pow_mod_totient_modEq`, `units_pow_eq_one_iff`, `two_mul_card_le_of_ne_top`, `card_units_eq_mul_card_QR`, `card_QR_prime`, `sq_pow_div_four_succ`, `fmultNat_eq_mul_prime`; and the core of the sorried `elGamal_correct`) | accepted; scheduled (user direction 2026-11-06: Mathlib first) | Replace by Mathlib's (alias where a name is load-bearing), clean-up part 2 item M; rows in fill-owned files (`Candidates/*`) after those fills land, as landing edits. The fill briefs cite the report's Mathlib names. |
