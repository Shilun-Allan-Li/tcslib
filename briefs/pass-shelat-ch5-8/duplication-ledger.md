# Duplication ledger: Pass–shelat ch. 5–8

Accepted debt, each entry acknowledged by the user, with its scheduled resolution.

| ID | New declaration (where) | Existing copy (where) | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DL-1 | `TCSlib.InformationTheory.abs_probTrue_sub_le_statDist` (#183, `InformationTheory/Extractors.lean`, for `main`) | `TCSlib.Cryptography.abs_sum_sub_le_statDist` (`Foundations/Experiments.lean`, Garg's concrete layer, on `cryptography/pass-shelat-ch2-4` and `cryptography/garg-ch1-3`; not on `main`) | accepted 2026-11-04 (user) | No copy on `main` today. When the concrete layer lands on `main`, its lemma becomes a one-line corollary of #183's (a `Finset` test is the `Bool` test `(· ∈ T)`) or is removed. Gate 01 pack erratum E1. |

## Inherited with ch. 2–4 (found 2026-11-05; acknowledged 2026-11-05 by the user: clean up now)

This campaign owns ch. 2–4 since 2026-11-05 (plan, decision log). These duplicates predate it.

| ID | Copies (where) | Status | Proposed resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| DL-2 | XOR of encodings is the encoding of the Boolean sum, `zipWith xor (ofFn a) (ofFn b) = ofFn (a + b)`, stated three times: `TCSlib.Cryptography.zipWith_xor_ofFn_add` (`Asymptotic/HardCoreLoops.lean`; it was `zipWith_xor_ofFn`, renamed by the base repair to end the name clash with `Encryption.lean`'s different lemma); `TCSlib.Cryptography.zipWith_xor_ofFn_eq_add` (`Asymptotic/MultiMessage.lean`); `TCSlib.Cryptography.MultiMsg.zipWith_xor_ofFn_eq_add` (`Asymptotic/MultiMessageLemmas.lean`) | accepted; scheduled now | Keep the most upstream copy (`HardCoreLoops`) and point the other two at it, in a ch. 2–4 cleanup PR. |
| DL-3 | `pairEncode a b ≠ []`, stated four times: `GGMRed.pairEncode_ne_nil` (`Asymptotic/GGMReduction.lean`), `GI.pairEncode_ne_nil` (`ZeroKnowledge/GraphIsomorphism/Proofs.lean`), `ColMachines.pairEncode_ne_nil` (`ZeroKnowledge/ThreeColoring/Machines.lean`); and, on `main`, `Complexity.pairEncode_ne_nil` (`Complexity/SpaceComplexity/Logspace/InputAccess.lean`), the copy that made the merge's ambiguity | accepted; scheduled now | `main` is merged (#186). Remove the three local copies in favour of `Complexity.pairEncode_ne_nil`, in the same cleanup PR. |
| DL-4 | Not a copy (different carriers): the sampler-based `StatClose` (`Asymptotic/Sampling.lean`) and `main`'s `EpsClose` on `FinDist` (`InformationTheory/Extractors.lean`, #183) | accepted; scheduled now | A bridge lemma, in the same cleanup PR (user, 2026-11-05). |
| DL-5 | Not a copy (different carriers; found by the gate 02 round 2 review): `Games.guessAdv_eq_half_advantage` and `Games.accept_guessGame` (games) and the concrete layer's `predict_eq` (`Asymptotic/Ensembles.lean`, on `uprob` over seed spaces), both the identity behind [PS10, Lemma 73.8] | disclosed in the docstring (gate 02 closing commit) | Derive one from the other through bridge B2 when ch. 2–4 lands on `main`. |

## Found in the ch. 5–8 statement phase (2026-11-05)

| # | Statement | Copies | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DL-6 | The `j`-th block of `c` bits of a coin string, `(r.drop (j * c)).take c`, stated three times: `coinSlice` (`ZeroKnowledge/GraphIsomorphism.lean`, ch. 2–4), `Authentication.coinBlock` (`Authentication/Lamport.lean`, prong A), `Protocol.phaseSlice` (`Composability/SequentialZK.lean`, prong C) | found by the Lamport worker and the maintainer | Before the ch. 5–8 statement gate: one copy in a shared upstream module, with its length lemma, used by all three. |
| DL-7 | `List.ofFn (padFin ℓ w) = w` for `|w| = ℓ`: `Authentication.ofFn_padFin_of_length` (`Lamport.lean`) is the equal-length case of ch. 2–4's `ofFn_padFin_of_le` (`Asymptotic/Collections.lean`); `Composability.length_eval_of_length` (`CCA2Scheme.lean`) repeats the step inline | found by the Lamport worker | Before the ch. 5–8 statement gate: use `ofFn_padFin_of_le (le_of_eq h)`. |
