# Gate 03l ([PS10] ch. 2–4, the `Randomized/Build/` machine layer and the clean-module host), round 3: delta audit pack

**What is audited:** the repair of round 2, on `cryptography/pass-shelat-ch2-4` at `1ea782b11617e15a51c3e2f6bd15dd0e3befbd95` (the merge of
[Shilun-Allan-Li/tcslib#206](https://github.com/Shilun-Allan-Li/tcslib/pull/206), the gate 03 repair batch, and the records commits of 2026-11-06).
- **The round 2 findings** are `findings/gate03l-r2-findings.md` (in the bundle, verbatim), and the resolutions `resolutions-03l-r2.md`.
- **The repair:** #206's diff (`evidence-repairs/03-batch/repair.diff.txt`; it covers five gates, and only this pack's files are under audit) and the records changes named in the resolutions.
- **The deliverable:** **`gate03l-r3-findings.md`**.

The bundle holds this pack, then every file named below under a `## ===== <path> =====` header. **The source is attached separately:** [PS10] (PDF; book page = PDF page − 12).

## Brief for the auditor

1. **Verify each resolution** of `resolutions-03l-r2.md`: fixed, recorded, scheduled, or not resolved (and why).
2. **Audit the changed surface afresh:**
   - **the head envelopes of H14** (the major): `Clean.envelope`, `host_call_envelope`, `host_clean_envelope`. Restate each; does the set meet policy §1's head-envelope requirement for a public host contract, as the round 2 finding asked? Are their bounds correct (coarse bounds from the time bound)?
   - the eight `simps` equations and the new lemmas in `axioms-03l.log` (minor 2).
3. **Check that nothing else changed** in this pack's files: the statement diff (`statements.txt`) lists every added and changed declaration of the batch.

Pack 03a's severity guide applies. Attempt at least one adversarial instantiation against the changed surface. Do not give a blanket approval.

## Scope

| Item | Where |
|---|---|
| Findings, resolutions, the diff | as above |
| Under audit, at the pin | `TuringMachine/Build/ModuleHost.lean`; records: `machine-library-design.md` §14 (row H14), `duplication-ledger.md` (DL-20), `resolutions-03l-r1.md` |
| Context | `03l-pack.md` and earlier round packs, `03a-pack.md`, `policy.md` |

## Attestations (maintainer execution claims; `evidence-repairs/03-batch/`)

- **Elaboration** (`replay.log`): the 128 modules downstream of #206's 21 changed files, then `audits/pass-shelat/Checks`, each checked alone after a base sync (`base-sync.log`): **129 of 129 pass, 0 errors**; every module's `sorry` count equals the base. A maintainer re-check of 8 key modules also passes (`maintainer-recheck.log`).
- **Axioms** (`axioms.log`, `axioms-03l.log`): 549 prints over the 21 files, compared with the base: no axiom set changed; the 10 new lemmas are standard.
- **Seal** (`seal.log`): the consumers of `ProverBounded` pass sealed (their base versions fail); the new proofs pass with the definitions they could unfold sealed.
- **Lint** (`lint.log`): `scripts/style_lint.py` and `scripts/campaign_style_lint.py --check8b`, compared with the base: no new finding.
- **Statements** (`statements.txt`): 10 added, 2 changed (the two ruled ones in `NP.lean`), 0 removed.
