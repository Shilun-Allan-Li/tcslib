# External audit pack — Phase 3 skeleton + fill round 1

Audits commit `f8621285` on `complexity/arora-barak-ch1`. Two things happened since
the closed phase-2 loop (`audits/phase2-resolutions.md`): **(a)** 20 of the 28
outstanding `sorry`s were replaced by real, machine-checked proofs, together with 16
new supporting declarations, and **(b)** the phase-3 skeleton landed — machine
encodings and the universal machine, statements only (5 new `sorry`s; 13 total).
Record findings in `audits/phase3-findings.md`.

**Repository-side attestations** (verify or challenge, but they need not be redone
blind): a comment-stripped git comparison against the phase-2 gate commit `fb91cf88`
shows **no previously audited declaration signature changed and none was removed**;
all 18 modules elaborate with zero errors; the 8 remaining phase-1/2 `sorry`s are
textually unchanged from their audited forms.

## What changed

**Filled (no longer `sorry`; proofs are Lean-checked, so audit *statements* of the
new supporting lemmas, not tactics):** `ComputesInTime.mono`, `output_length_le`,
`output_prefix`; all six oracle obligations (`step_eq_of_ne_qQuery`,
`queryString_length_le`, `runFrom_workTapes_blank`, `runFrom_ofMultiTapeTM`,
`computesInTime_ofMultiTapeTM`, `runFrom_plainEmptyOracle`); `DTIME.mono`,
`DTIME_eq_empty_of_exists_zero`; `mem_P_of_dtime_le`, `mem_P_iff`,
`dtime_one_subset_P`; `PAL_mem_P`; `one_work_tape_binary` (chaining the two still-
`sorry`d simulations); the three ModelInvariance corollaries; and
`computesFunInTime_id`, proved with an explicit one-state copy machine (`idTM`) and
its run invariant — the first fully machine-checked concrete computation in the model.

**New public supporting declarations to blind-restate:** `Turing.succ_pow_le`;
`OracleTM.workTapePos_step_le`, `OracleTM.workTapes_step_eq_of_ne`;
`Cfg.embedOracle_inputSymbol`, `Cfg.embedOracle_workTapeSymbols`,
`Cfg.embedOracle_state_eq_none`, `Cfg.embedOracle_output`, `Cfg.embedOracle_apply`,
`Cfg.embedOracle_init`; `OracleTM.step_ofMultiTapeTM`,
`OracleTM.step_plainEmptyOracle`. (Private helpers — `idTM`, `idTM_run`,
`apply_workTapes_eq_of_ne`, `runFrom_workTapes_invariant` — are internal but attached
for completeness.)

**Still `sorry` from phases 1-2 (8, all heavy constructions, statements unchanged
since their audited rounds):** `computesFunInTime_const`, `computesFunInTime_comp`,
`alphabet_reduction`, `one_work_tape`, `nonnegative_heads`, `oblivious_of_mem_DTIME`,
`timeConstructible_id`, `PAL_mem_DTIME_linear`.

**New phase-3 surface (5 `sorry`s + definitions) — the main blind-restatement
target:** `Encoding.lean` (`CodeTM`, `CodeTM.toFinTM`, `pairEncode`, `MachineCode`,
`MachineCode.decode_encode` (proved), `exists_machineCode`, `exists_codeTM`) and
`Universal.lean` (`universal`, `universal_quadratic`, `timed_universal`).

## Brief for the auditor

Ground rules as in all previous rounds (trusted surface; no blanket approval).
Priority order:

1. **Blind-restate the phase-3 declarations** and compare against [AB09, §1.4,
   §1.4.1, Theorem 1.9, pp. 19-21]. This is new, unaudited surface.
2. **Blind-restate the new public supporting lemmas** (list above): each is now a
   *proved* statement others will build on — a wrong statement here is worse than a
   wrong sorry.
3. **Spot-check the fill round**: confirm the 8 remaining sorries match their audited
   forms and that nothing in the newly proved surface trivializes a downstream
   obligation (e.g. a helper lemma that accidentally assumes what a simulation must
   prove).
4. Assess the attestations in the header.

## Specific questions

1. `pairEncode` (doubled bits + `[false, true]` separator + verbatim second string):
   is this actually self-delimiting — can the doubled region always be parsed
   unambiguously from the left (pairs are `00`/`11` until the first `01`)? Any edge
   case with empty `x` or empty `α`?
2. `MachineCode`: is `decode_encode_pad` (recovery under `true`-padding **of valid
   codes only**) the right weakening of [AB09]'s convention, and does it genuinely
   give property 2 (infinitely many representations)? Is totality-by-type the right
   rendering of property 1? Is the abstract-scheme design (statements relative to any
   `MachineCode`) faithful to the chapter, or does anything downstream (diagonalization
   in phase 4!) need a *fixed* scheme with additional properties — e.g. computability
   of `decode` by a machine, which the current spec does **not** demand? This is the
   question we most want scrutinized: phase 4's `HALT` and `UC` need `Mα(α)`-style
   self-application, and an uncomputable `decode` would trivialize nothing here but
   might block phase 4's reductions.
3. `exists_codeTM`: is the per-input iff (`ComputesInTime` both ways) strong enough
   for the universal-machine chaining, or does the chain need output/timing in a form
   this iff loses?
4. `universal`: quantifier order (`∃ U, ∀ M, ∃ C, ∀ x out t`) versus
   [AB09, Theorem 1.9] — faithful? Is the **linear** bound `C · (t + 1)` for
   already-normal-form coded machines correct (the table scan is constant per step),
   and is the deviation note honest that the book's quadratic appears only in
   `universal_quadratic`?
5. `universal_quadratic`: function-level statement (via `ComputesFunInTime`) rather
   than [AB09]'s per-machine phrasing — anything lost? Constants composition
   `C_U · (c₁ (T+1)² + 1) ≤ C (T+1)²` valid?
6. `timed_universal`: are the two cases exhaustive and correctly phrased (note the
   second is `∀ output, ¬ComputesInTime` — "does not halt within `t`")? Is
   `true :: output` / `[false]` a sound failure convention (can a successful `true ::
   output` ever collide with the failure output `[false]`? — `true ≠ false`); is the
   quadratic clock budget right; and does the statement's use of `Nat.bits t` for
   `⌞t⌟` match `TimeConstructible`'s convention?
7. `idTM` (proved): does the invariant `idTM_run` (live state, head at `t + 1`,
   output = first `t` bits) plus the final halting step actually witness
   `ComputesFunInTime id (fun n => 1 * (n + 1))`? Sanity-check the empty-input case
   (`t = 0`, halts at step 1 with output `[]`).
8. Adversarial instantiations to attempt: `CodeTM` with `numStates = 0` through
   `universal`; `pairEncode [] α`; a `MachineCode` whose `encode` is constant (does
   anything break, i.e. do the specs secretly permit degenerate schemes that make
   `universal` false or vacuous?); `t = 0` through all three universal statements.

# Formalization Plan: Arora-Barak Chapter 1

**Branch:** `complexity/arora-barak-ch1` · **Governing standards:** [`policy.md`](policy.md)

This document is the working plan for formalizing Chapter 1 of Arora & Barak,
*Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach* (CUP 2009) — "The computational model — and
why it doesn't matter" (book pages 9–37) — in TCSlib. It records the foundation decision,
the architecture that keeps the model robust to variations (oracles, nondeterminism), the
module layout, and the phasing. Source tag throughout the development: `[AB09]`.

## 1. Scope: what Chapter 1 contains

| Section | Content | In scope |
|---|---|---|
| §1.2 | k-tape TM `(Γ, Q, δ)`: read-only input tape, work tapes, output tape (read-write in [AB09]; append-only write-only in our model — a variation [AB09, p. 19] itself sanctions, declared in `DTIME.lean`); start configuration; halting; Example 1.1 (palindromes in 3n steps) | Yes |
| §1.3 | Computing `f` in time `T(n)` (Def 1.3); time-constructibility; Claim 1.5 (alphabet reduction, `4 log|Γ|` slowdown); Claim 1.6 (k tapes → 1 tape, `5kT²`); Remark 1.7 (oblivious TMs); Claim 1.8 (bidirectional → unidirectional, `4T`) | Yes (oblivious: statement only at first) |
| §1.4 | Machines as strings: every string decodes to some TM, every TM has infinitely many encodings; universal TM; Theorem 1.9 (universal simulation), relaxed `O(T²)` version; time-bounded universal TM | Yes |
| §1.5 | Uncomputability: `UC` via diagonalization (Thm 1.10); `HALT` via reduction (Thm 1.11); §1.5.2 Gödel discussion | Thms 1.10–1.11 yes; Gödel material is prose — out of scope |
| §1.6 | `DTIME(T(n))` (Def 1.12, with constant absorption), `P` (Def 1.13), examples | Yes |
| §1.7 | Hennie-Stearns `O(T log T)` universal simulation (amortized zone argument) | Stretch goal, off the critical path |

Additionally in scope, ahead of the book's own ordering: the **oracle TM** definition
(the book defers it to §3.4). We pull it forward to validate that the architecture supports
model variations before the expensive theorems are built on it.

## 2. Foundation decision

**Decision: vendor cslib's multi-tape TM model; do not build on Mathlib's TMs; do not take
cslib as a dependency.** Findings behind this (surveyed Sept 2026, against our pinned
mathlib `029db123ddaa`, toolchain v4.25.0):

- **Mathlib** is a computability library, not a complexity library. It has no multi-tape TM
  (TM0/TM1 are single-tape, TM2 is a stack machine); its model-simulation theorems carry no
  time bounds; `TM2ComputableInPolyTime` is a stub whose only instance is `id`. Building
  Arora-Barak on it means fighting the design. What we do reuse: `Language`,
  `Turing.FinEncoding`, and (later, as an optional bridge) the recursion-theory stack
  (`Nat.Partrec`, `Halting`/Rice, `Reduce`, `RecursiveIn`).
- **cslib** (github.com/leanprover/cslib, `Cslib/Computability/Machines/Turing/MultiTape/`,
  Apache-2.0) has an Arora-Barak-style `MultiTapeTM` (its write-only output tape is an
  [AB09, p. 19]-sanctioned variation of the book's read-write one): read-only input
  tape, k work tapes, explicit time and space semantics, a nondeterministic
  variant, and configuration-count bounds — actively developed, with a complexity roadmap
  (issue #611) that plans oracles as a wrapper over any model.
- **Why vendor rather than depend:** cslib targets Lean v4.35.0-rc1 with the new module
  system; TCSlib is pinned to v4.25.0 and the PFR dependency chains us there. The vendored
  surface is small (~1,400 lines). We stay structurally aligned with upstream so we can
  migrate to a real dependency at the next toolchain bump, and upstream anything we prove
  that they lack (universal TM, robustness claims).
- Vendored files follow `policy.md` §2: original copyright headers preserved, source commit
  recorded, local modifications listed (expected: de-module-system syntax, import-path
  ports to v4.25 mathlib).

Reference mechanization to mine for proof architecture: the Isabelle AFP entry
`Cook_Levin` (Balbach) — the only completed Arora-Barak-faithful development. Its lemma
decomposition, especially for TM composition and the universal machine, transfers.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 The Action/apply split (model variations)

cslib's configuration layer mentions no machine: a step is an **`Action`** (input-head
move, per-work-tape write/move, optional output symbol, successor state) plus
**`Action.apply`** (its effect on a configuration). A *machine* is then just the thing
that **chooses** the action from the current state and read symbols. Every model twist is a
different chooser over the same configurations, the same `apply`, and the same run/time/
space measures:

| Model | Chooser |
|---|---|
| Deterministic TM (Ch. 1) | function `State × reads → Action` |
| Nondeterministic TM (Ch. 2) | relation over actions |
| Oracle TM (§3.4, Definition 3.4, pulled forward) | function consulting `O : Language _` via query tape and `q_query`/`q_yes`/`q_no` states (pairwise distinct: `OracleTM.WellFormed`) |
| Probabilistic TM (Ch. 7, future) | two transition functions + coin |

Because `DTIME`-style definitions are stated over the shared run layer, `P`, `Pᴼ`, and
later `NP`/`BPP` are instances of one pattern, not parallel developments. Phase 1 locks
the design with sanity theorems in both directions: a plain machine embeds as an oracle
machine whose runs are in lockstep with the original under *every* oracle
(`ofMultiTapeTM`), and conversely an oracle machine run with the empty oracle is
eliminated into a plain machine in exact lockstep (`plainEmptyOracle`).

### 3.2 Finiteness: raw layer vs. bundled layer

Finiteness of `Γ` and `Q` is mathematically non-negotiable: with infinite states, δ can
memorize the input and decide any language in linear time (P would collapse to all
languages), and `⌞M⌟` has no finite representation. The design question is only *where*
the hypothesis lives:

- **Raw layer** (`MultiTapeTM k Γ Q`, parametric types, no finiteness): configurations,
  `step`, runs, time/space counting, and simulation *constructions*. Deferring finiteness
  here keeps semantics lemmas clean and lets compound state types (`Q × Γᵏ`, `Option Q`,
  sums) arise without instance-threading; finiteness of a constructed machine is an
  afterthought (`inferInstance`). This follows both cslib and mathlib TM0/TM1 practice.
- **Bundled layer** (`FinTM Symbol`: a raw machine bundled with `Fintype`/`DecidableEq`
  instances for its *state* type — analogous to mathlib's `FinTM2`): **all headline
  definitions and theorems** — `DTIME`, `P`, `⌞M⌟`, Theorem 1.9, oracle classes — are
  stated exclusively over the bundled layer, so a finiteness hypothesis can never be
  forgotten. The alphabet is *not* bundled: it stays an explicit parameter, fixed to
  `Bool` by the headline classes; results over a general `Symbol` (e.g. machine
  encodings) take `[Fintype Symbol]`/`[DecidableEq Symbol]` at their statements, and
  oracle complexity classes (Ch. 3) will introduce a finite oracle-machine bundle
  before they are defined. Encoding needs `Fintype`/`DecidableEq` as *data* (δ's table
  must be enumerated), which is why the bundle carries instances rather than `Finite`
  propositions.

Per `policy.md` §1 (layering), the raw layer is internal plumbing; the bundled layer is
the textbook object.

### 3.3 Conventions

- **Strings/languages:** `{0,1}*` as in the book; languages via mathlib's `Language`.
- **Namespaces:** `Turing` for the vendored core (minimizes diff against upstream; no
  clashes with mathlib's `Turing.*` at our pin), `Complexity` for classes and
  uncomputability. Revisit only if a clash appears.
- **NP/NTM:** strictly Chapter 1 here. cslib's nondeterministic file is in the vendorable
  set but lands with the Chapter 2 effort.

## 4. Module layout

```

## 5. Phasing

Each phase lands first as a **compiling sorry-skeleton** (the GraphTheory/Core precedent):
statements are the contract, proofs fill in via the sorry-ladder workflow. Per `policy.md`
§3, proof sketches are written at skeleton time — each `sorry` corresponds to a named
sketch step. After each phase compiles: dep-graph rebuild, `/blueprint-extract`,
`blueprint_validate.py --strict`, `dataset_hygiene.py --strict`. The blueprint is
**late-bound**: extraction runs only at phase boundaries, and no blueprint LaTeX is
written by hand ahead of the Lean.

### Audit protocol (between phases)

Right after a phase's skeleton lands — statements frozen, proofs mostly `sorry` — an
**external audit** runs before the next phase begins: an LLM from a different vendor, in
a fresh context, reviews the phase's trusted surface (definitions, theorem statements,
remaining sorries) against the book, adversarially. Statement bugs are the dominant
failure mode of formalization (Lean already checks proofs) and are cheapest to fix at
this moment. Mechanics: instantiate `audits/TEMPLATE.md` as `audits/phaseN-pack.md`, hand
it plus the listed files to the auditor, record results in `audits/phaseN-findings.md`;
every finding is fixed or explicitly waived before the next phase starts. An optional
light second pass when a phase's proofs complete diffs the statements for quiet
weakening. Audits complement, not replace, in-Lean sanity theorems, which are the
machine-checked and permanent form of the same checks.

1. **Core model + classes.** Port the two vendored files to v4.25; `Finite.lean`;
   `ComputesInTime`, `decides`, `DTIME`, `P`; the oracle wrapper + trivial-oracle sanity
   theorem; PAL as an end-to-end usability check. *This phase alone unblocks future
   chapters (NP needs only these definitions).*
2. **Robustness.** Claims 1.5, 1.6, 1.8; `Composition.lean` combinators; corollary that P
   is invariant under the model tweaks. First real machine-construction proofs — builds
   the simulation vocabulary everything later reuses. The convention obligations
   recorded by the phase-1 audit are dispositioned per the phase-2 audit (findings 3
   and 13): the append-only-output and initialization bridges are **waived** (no
   read-write-output model is formalized; no exact step count is ever imported from
   [AB09]), to be revisited only if a downstream result needs a formal bridge; the
   persistent vs auto-erased query-tape statement (polynomial overhead only — constant
   overhead provably impossible) moves to the Chapter 3 oracle-class work.
3. **Encodings + universal machine.** `⌞M⌟` with totality and padding lemmas; Theorem 1.9
   in the relaxed `O(T²)` form (U simulates the one-work-tape *binary* normal form from
   phase 2 — `FinTM Bool`, i.e. three tape symbols counting blank; if the construction
   wants [AB09]'s four-symbol alphabet, that is an additional named embedding step) and
   the time-bounded variant.
4. **Uncomputability.** Thm 1.10 (needs only encoding + semantics; the diagonalization is
   short); Thm 1.11 (needs composition + the universal machine).
5. **Stretch — explicitly off the critical path.** §1.7's `O(T log T)` simulation;
   oblivious TMs; the RAM-TM exercise (Ex 1.9); the mathlib recursion-theory bridge.

**Blueprint reference ingestion:** ingest Chapter 1 as
`blueprint/src/references/arora-barak-ch01-*.md` (raw/clean pair, ch. 13 shows the format)
so `\statementsource`/`\proofsource` citations are possible once proofmatch runs are
approved.

## 6. Risks and honest effort assessment

- **The proof-sketch gap is the main cost.** The book proves Claims 1.5/1.6 and Thm 1.9 in
  a paragraph each; formally these are the expensive items. The AFP `Cook_Levin` entry
  spent most of its effort exactly here. `Composition.lean` is the hidden load-bearing
  file — budget for it.
- **Vendoring means drift** against a fast-moving upstream. Mitigation: minimal local
  modification, source commit recorded per file, periodic upstream diffs.
- **Definitions before theorems pays off:** phases 1–2 already give TCSlib a citable,
  blueprint-documented model of computation with P and oracles, onto which the existing
  `Complexity/NPReductions/` files can eventually be retargeted — even if phases 3–5 fill
  slowly.

## 7. Decision log

| Decision | Status |
|---|---|
| Vendor cslib `MultiTapeTM`; reuse mathlib only for `Language`/`FinEncoding`/bridge | Decided |
| Finiteness deferred in raw layer, enforced via bundled `FinTM` for all headline defs | Decided |
| Oracle wrapper lands in phase 1 (ahead of book order) | Decided |
| Work on branch `complexity/arora-barak-ch1`; verify via `scripts/lean_check.sh` (CI runs on main only) | Decided |
| Namespaces: `Turing` (vendored core) / `Complexity` (classes) | Working assumption; revisit on clash |
| NP/NTM signatures deferred to Chapter 2 work | Decided |
| §1.7 `O(T log T)` and oblivious-TM proofs are stretch goals | Decided |
| Blueprint: late-bound — generated from compiled Lean at phase boundaries only, nothing hand-written ahead of the Lean | Decided |
| External audits between phases: cross-vendor LLM with prepared packs (`audits/`), findings gate the next phase | Decided |
| Vendored cslib source commit: `a374775894efb9b7196cccf11235c60a97086dc1` (2026-09-14); relational semantics (`RelatesInSteps`) dropped in the port | Decided |
| Phase-1 audit round 1 (`audits/phase1-findings.md`): all 8 sorries confirmed true; 3 majors fixed — `TimeConstructible` repaired to `∃ c > 0, … c·(T n + 1)` (the literal exact bound refutes AB's own `id` example in this model), `OracleTM.WellFormed` added, oracle-tape constant-overhead claim corrected to polynomial; minors swept; audit-requested sanity statements added. Oracle citation is [AB09, Definition 3.4] (not 3.6) | Decided |
| Phase 1 requires a clean re-audit of the fixes before phase 2 starts | Decided |
| Phase-1 audit round 2 (`audits/phase1-reaudit-findings.md`): zero blockers/majors — all round-1 resolutions verified, all 8 new sorries confirmed true (with a worked `timeConstructible_id` witness machine reusable in the fill phase); 5 prose minors swept, blankness-certificate lemma added per note 6. **Phase-1 audit gate closed**; see `audits/phase1-resolutions.md` | Decided |
| Phase-2 renderings: Claim 1.6 rendered as **one work tape** (the merged input/work/output single-tape model is a genuinely different structure — it has an `Ω(n²)` palindrome lower bound our model beats — and is out of scope, with no identification claimed); Claim 1.8 rendered as **`NonnegativeHeads`** (our tapes are already bidirectional, so the meaningful direction is unidirectional use); obliviousness constrains input/work-head trajectories only — it does **not** force length-determined halting (phase-2 audit finding 1 refuted that with a stationary-head counterexample) and leaves emission schedules unconstrained; the `TimeConstructible` hypothesis in Exercise 1.5 is needed by the padding construction, not by the definition | Decided — audited (phase-2 round 1) |
| Output-tape/initialization convention obligations (phase-1 finding 4): **waived**, per phase-2 audit finding 3 — no formal bridge is possible without formalizing [AB09]'s read-write-output model, which this development does not do; the compensating restriction is that no exact-step-count transfer from [AB09] is ever claimed (all bounds carry existential constants, all results are self-contained in-model). The buffer-and-flush technique is documented in `Composition.lean`; a formal bridge is added only if a downstream result needs it | Decided — waiver accepted by phase-2 audit as a labeled option |
| Persistent-vs-erased query-tape polynomial-overhead statement moved from phase 2 to the Chapter 3 oracle-class work, where polynomial overhead is meaningful (class level); the impossibility of constant overhead stays documented in `Oracle.lean`. Outstanding obligation before importing any oracle-class invariance | Decided — deferral accepted by phase-2 audit (finding 13) |
| Phase-2 audit round 1 (`audits/phase2-findings.md`): 4 majors, 6 minors, 3 notes — **no theorem formula refuted**; all 11 new sorries assessed true as stated. Majors were prose/sketch-level: the false frozen-heads implication removed, the oblivious-simulation sketch replaced by the audit's corrected construction, the convention-discharge overclaim converted to the waiver above, ModelInvariance's invariance claims stated at delivered strength (alphabet: DTIME up to constants; tape count: P only). Sketch repairs: all-blank block for logical blank (1.5), tagged `Option Γ` payloads and `k = 0` case (1.6), piecewise fold coordinate with origin tags and safe-halt on non-embedded symbols (1.8) | Decided |
| Fill round 1 (commit `f8621285`): 20 of 28 phase-1/2 sorries proved — all semantics/arithmetic/chaining obligations, both oracle lockstep theorems, `mem_P_iff`, and `computesFunInTime_id` with an explicit machine. The 8 remaining sorries are exactly the heavy machine constructions (`const`, `comp`, the four robustness simulations, `timeConstructible_id`, `PAL_mem_DTIME_linear`), each with an audited outline. Repository-side verification: no audited declaration signature changed or was removed. Phase-3 skeleton delivered (5 statement sorries): `CodeTM`, abstract `MachineCode` scheme, `pairEncode`, Theorem 1.9 (linear for coded machines / relaxed quadratic / timed). Audit round covering fills + phase-3 pending | Decided |
| Phase-2 audit round 2 (`audits/phase2-reaudit-findings.md`): zero blockers/majors — both corrected load-bearing sketches certified as adequate proof outlines; 4 prose minors swept (fold alphabet `Bool × Option Γ × Option Γ`, waiver-prose synchronization, `O((k+1)·L)` overhead, one-work-tape *binary* normal form in phase 3); Lean-code identity between the audited commits verified repository-side by comment-stripped git comparison. **Phase-2 audit gate closed**; see `audits/phase2-resolutions.md` | Decided |
| Fate of this file at merge (graduate to `docs/` vs. superseded by blueprint) | Open — decide at merge time |

Standards for all Lean contributions to this repository, whether written by humans or by
agents. This document covers three things: **modularity** (how code is organized),
**attribution** (how every result is traced to a source), and **proof sketches** (how every
formal proof is accompanied by readable mathematics).

It complements, and does not replace:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — build workflows, import rules, CI integration points.
- `AGENTS.md` / `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — the sorry-ladder proof workflow and agent roster.
- `blueprint/BLUEPRINT_PIPELINE.md` — how blueprint entries are generated and validated.

Where this document names an existing mechanism (blueprint macros, hygiene scripts), the
policy is to *use that mechanism*, not to invent a parallel one.

## 1. Modularity

**Layout.** Content lives at `TCSlib/<Area>/<Topic>/<Piece>.lean`, one coherent concept or
lemma cluster per file, with a facade file `TCSlib/<Area>/<Topic>.lean` that imports every
child and carries a `/-! -/` module docstring with a `## Contents` list (one line per child).
See `TCSlib/Complexity/NPReductions.lean` for the reference example.

**File size.** Target 150–600 lines per math file. A file approaching 1000 lines should be
split unless there is a positive reason not to (e.g. a single long proof that cannot be
usefully decomposed).

**Exports.** Every new topic facade must be imported from `TCSlib.lean`. CI only builds what
is reachable from `TCSlib.lean`; an unexported file is invisible to CI, docs, and the
blueprint.

**Imports.** Precise module imports only. A bare `import Mathlib` fails CI. Import only what
the file uses.

**Namespaces.** Namespaces are area-local: pick one namespace root per topic and use it
consistently within that topic. Do not leak auxiliary definitions into the root namespace;
mark internal helpers `private` or put them in a dedicated inner namespace.

**Layering.** Keep definition files separate from heavyweight theorem files, so that
downstream work can import a model or a class definition without pulling in every proof about
it. When a development has both a "raw/general" layer and a "bundled" layer (e.g. a machine
model that is parametric in its types, plus a bundled version carrying finiteness instances),
headline definitions and theorems are stated against the bundled layer; the raw layer is
internal plumbing.

**Helpers.** Foundational helper lemmas that serve a whole area belong in that area's
`Basic.lean`, not in the file that first needed them.

**File header.** Every math file begins with the Mathlib-style copyright block, its imports,
the repo-standard options

```
set_option maxHeartbeats 0
set_option relaxedAutoImplicit false
set_option autoImplicit false
```

then a module docstring containing `# Title`, `## Main definitions`, `## Main results`, and
`## References` (see §2).

## 2. Attribution

Every mathematical statement in the library must be traceable to a source, at the level of
precision of a textbook theorem number or a paper section.

**File-level.** Every math file's module docstring contains a `## References` section giving
full citations with short tags, e.g.

```
## References

* [AB09] S. Arora, B. Barak, *Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach*,
  Cambridge University Press, 2009.
```

**Declaration-level.** Every definition, theorem, and lemma that corresponds to a result in
a source carries the tag with a precise location in its docstring: `[AB09, Claim 1.6]`,
`[AB09, §1.7]`, `[GRS25, Thm 4.2.1]`. Purely technical glue lemmas with no textbook
counterpart may omit the tag; anything a reader would recognize as "a result" may not.

**Deviations.** If the formal statement deviates from the source — different constants,
strengthened or weakened hypotheses, a reformulation — the docstring must say so and briefly
say why (e.g. "stated with explicit constant 5k rather than O(·), following the proof").

**Blueprint.** When an ingested reference exists under `blueprint/src/references/`, blueprint
entries use `\statementsource{<ref>}{<anchor>}` and `\proofsource{<ref>}{<anchor>}` to cite
it, subject to the existing rule that these are written only after an approved proofmatch
run. When starting a new chapter or paper, ingest it as a reference pair
(`<name>.raw.md` + `<name>.md`) so these citations are possible.

**Vendored code.** Lean code adapted from another project keeps the original copyright
header and license notice, and its file docstring names the source project, the commit it
was taken from, and a summary of local modifications.

## 3. Proof sketches

Every nontrivial formal proof is accompanied by a human-readable English proof sketch, kept
next to the Lean it describes.

**What counts as nontrivial.** Rule of thumb: any proof longer than ~20 lines of tactics, or
that would rate difficulty ≥ 3 on the blueprint scale. One-line `simp`/`omega`/`exact`
proofs need no sketch.

**Where sketches live.** In the Lean file itself:

- For most theorems: a `**Proof sketch.**` paragraph at the end of the theorem's docstring,
  written in mathematical English (not Lean identifiers), naming the key intermediate steps.
- For long proofs: additionally, short comments at the major `have`/section boundaries tying
  the tactics back to the sketch's steps.

The named intermediate steps of a sketch should be visible in the formalization as `have`s
or standalone lemmas — if the sketch says "first reduce to the one-tape case", there should
be a lemma that is that reduction.

**Where sketches do not live.** Not in the blueprint. Blueprint statement entries state
claims only; `scripts/dataset_hygiene.py --strict` hard-fails on proof content there. The
blueprint records *what* is true and its dependency structure; the Lean docstrings record
*why* it is true.

**Sketches and the sorry ladder.** When landing a sorry-skeleton, write the sketch at
skeleton time — the sketch *is* the plan, and each `sorry` should correspond to a named step
of it. A skeleton whose sketch cannot be written is not ready to land.

**Synchronization.** When a proof strategy changes, the sketch changes in the same commit.
A sketch that describes a proof the code no longer performs is worse than no sketch.

## Review checklist

Before merging new Lean content, check:

1. Files follow the Area/Topic layout with a facade, and `TCSlib.lean` exports are updated.
2. Imports are precise; no bare `import Mathlib`.
3. Every file has a `## References` section; every source-derived declaration has a
   `[Tag, location]` in its docstring; deviations from sources are noted.
4. Every nontrivial proof (or sorry-stub standing in for one) has a proof sketch.
5. `zsh scripts/lean_check.sh <file>` reports zero errors for each touched file.
6. If blueprint content was touched: `python3 scripts/blueprint_validate.py --strict` and
   `python3 scripts/dataset_hygiene.py --strict` pass.

# Machines as strings

[AB09, §1.4]: machines can be represented as binary strings, in such a way that
**(1)** every string represents some machine, and **(2)** every machine is represented
by infinitely many strings. This file provides the *code normal form* (`CodeTM`: one
work tape, binary alphabet, `Fin`-states — encodability requires fixing concrete
parameters, and by `Turing.FinTM.one_work_tape_binary` this normal form loses only a
quadratic factor), the specification `MachineCode` of a representation scheme with
[AB09]'s two properties, and the self-delimiting input pairing used by the universal
machine.

## Design and deviations from [AB09]

* [AB09] fixes one concrete representation ("the list of all inputs and outputs of the
  transition function") and standing conventions. We specify the representation
  *abstractly* as a `MachineCode` structure carrying exactly the properties the
  development uses, state the universal machine relative to an arbitrary `MachineCode`
  (`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Universal`), and record the existence of a
  concrete scheme as a separate obligation (`exists_machineCode`). This keeps every
  downstream theorem independent of encoding details.
* Property (2) is stated as invariance under **`true`-padding of valid codes**
  (`decode_encode_pad`), the formal content of [AB09]'s "representations ending with
  arbitrarily many 1s are ignored" convention. We do not demand that padding be
  ignored on *arbitrary* strings — appending `true`s to an invalid code may complete
  it — only on codes, which suffices for infinitely many representations per machine.
* Totality of `decode` (property (1)) is enforced by its type: invalid strings decode
  to whatever canonical machine the scheme chooses [AB09, §1.4, property 1].

## Main definitions

* `Turing.CodeTM` — the code normal form; `Turing.CodeTM.toFinTM`.
* `Turing.pairEncode` — self-delimiting pairing of an input with a code.
* `Turing.MachineCode` — a representation scheme with [AB09, §1.4]'s properties.

## Main results

* `Turing.MachineCode.decode_encode` — decoding a code recovers the machine.
* `Turing.exists_machineCode` — a concrete scheme exists.
* `Turing.exists_codeTM` — every one-work-tape binary machine is equivalent to a
  coded machine (state relabeling).

**Proof sketch.** Encode `numStates` in self-delimiting doubled-bit form (as in
`pairEncode`), then the transition table as a sequence of fixed-width records: the
domain `Fin (numStates + 1) × Option Bool × Option Bool` is enumerated canonically,
and each `Action 1 Bool (Fin (numStates + 1))` value is serialized with fixed-width
binary fields (head move, optional write, optional output, optional successor state).
`decode` parses this format and returns the machine; on any parse failure — including
extra non-`true` material after a complete table — it returns a canonical trivial
machine, making it total. Because the parse consumes a self-delimited prefix of
determined length and ignores a trailing all-`true` suffix, appending `true`-padding
to a valid code does not change the parse, giving `decode_encode_pad`. -/

**Proof sketch.** `State` carries `Fintype`/`DecidableEq` instances and is inhabited
by `q₀`, so `Fintype.equivFin` gives `e : State ≃ Fin n` with `n = numStates + 1` for
some `numStates`. Transport the transition function along `e` (renaming states with
`Turing.Action.mapState` and reading them back through `e.symm`); the induced map on
configurations is a bijection commuting with `step` (the tapes and heads are
untouched), so runs, halting, and outputs correspond at every step. The tape-count
cast uses `hk : M.k = 1`. -/

# The universal Turing machine

[AB09, §1.4.1 and Theorem 1.9, relaxed form]: there is a single machine `U` that, given
`⟨x, α⟩`, simulates the machine coded by `α` on input `x` — with the simulation
overhead depending only on the coded machine, not on the input.

## Design and deviations from [AB09]

* Everything is stated relative to an arbitrary representation scheme
  (`Turing.MachineCode`), with the input convention `Turing.pairEncode x ⌞M⌟`.
* **The core simulation is linear, not quadratic**: coded machines (`Turing.CodeTM`)
  are already in one-work-tape binary normal form, so `U` pays only a constant factor
  `C` (depending on the coded machine) per simulated step — `C · (t + 1)`. [AB09]'s
  relaxed quadratic bound reappears in `universal_quadratic`, where an *arbitrary*
  binary machine is first normal-formed via [AB09, Claims 1.5-1.6]
  (`Turing.FinTM.one_work_tape_binary`), and that is where the `(t + 1)²` comes from.
  The `O(T log T)` sharpening ([AB09, §1.7], Hennie-Stearns) is the phase-5 stretch
  goal, off the critical path.
* **The timed machine's failure convention**: `U` outputs `true :: output` when the
  simulated machine halts within the budget with output `output`, and `[false]` on
  timeout — a concrete rendering of [AB09]'s "special failure symbol" (§1.4.1,
  "Universal TM with time bound"). Its budget is quadratic because maintaining the
  binary step counter costs `O(log t)` per simulated step.

## Main results

* `Turing.universal` — [AB09, Theorem 1.9] for coded machines, linear overhead.
* `Turing.universal_quadratic` — [AB09, Theorem 1.9, relaxed form] for arbitrary
  binary machines.
* `Turing.timed_universal` — the time-bounded universal machine [AB09, §1.4.1].

/-- **The universal machine** [AB09, Theorem 1.9, for coded machines]: for any
representation scheme there is a single machine `U` such that for every coded machine
`M` there is a constant `C` (depending only on `M`) with: whenever `M` halts on `x`
within `t` steps with output `output`, `U` on `⟨x, ⌞M⌟⟩` halts within `C · (t + 1)`
steps with the same output.

**Proof sketch** (after [AB09, Figure 1.6], simplified because `M` is already in
one-work-tape binary normal form). `U` has three work tapes: a *table* tape, a *state*
tape, and a *work* tape mirroring `M`'s work tape. Startup: `U` scans its input past
the doubled-bit region to the separator, decodes `α` onto the table tape (as the
fixed-width record table of the scheme's parse) and writes `M`'s initial state on the
state tape — cost bounded by a constant depending on `|⌞M⌟|`, absorbed into `C`. To
read `M`'s input bit `i`, `U` positions its input head at cell `2i` of the doubled
region (its simulated input-head position is maintained by moving two cells per
simulated move; the separator marks the boundary blank). Each simulated step: read the
work-tape symbol under the mirrored head and the simulated input symbol, scan the
table for the record matching (state, input read, work read) — at most the table
length, a constant in `t` — then apply the record: update the state tape, write/move
on the mirrored work tape, emit `M`'s emission verbatim. Halting and output transfer,
and the total is `C · (t + 1)`. -/

`U` buffers `M`'s emissions on a work tape instead of emitting them. If `M` halts
before the clock expires, `U` emits `true` and then flushes the buffered output; if

# Composition of Turing machine computations

Basic computability combinators for the bundled machines: the identity and constant
functions are linear-time computable, and time-bounded computability is closed under
composition. Composition is the load-bearing lemma of the whole development — the
universal machine (phase 3) and the `HALT` reduction (phase 4) are built from it — and
it is the part [AB09] never spells out, dispatching it with "high-level descriptions"
of machines. The Isabelle AFP `Cook_Levin` entry spends a large fraction of its effort
exactly here.

## Design

Composition is stated at the *specification* level (`ComputesFunInTime`), not as an
operator on raw machines: the composed machine is existentially produced. Internally
(proof obligation, not API) the construction simulates `M₁` with its emissions
redirected to a fresh work tape, then simulates `M₂` reading that tape in place of its
input tape.

**Convention obligation status** (phase-1 audit finding 4; phase-2 audit finding 3):
this file does *not* formally discharge the append-only vs read-write output-tape
bridge. Every statement here — hypotheses and conclusions alike — lives in the
append-only model, and [AB09]'s read-write-output machine is not formalized in this
development, so no simulation between the two conventions can even be stated yet. The
obligation is recorded in the plan's decision log as **waived**, with the compensating
restriction that no exact-step-count transfer from [AB09] is ever claimed: every bound
*adapted from the source* carries an existential constant (purely internal results,
such as the oracle lockstep lemmas, are legitimately exact but never cross a
convention), and every result is self-contained in-model. A formal bridge (a
read-write-output machine variant plus a simulation theorem) will be added if and only
if a downstream result needs it. What this file *does* provide is the buffer-and-flush
technique — an emission can be deferred to a work tape and flushed at the end — which
is what delayed or revisable output looks like *within this model*; whether the
append-only convention matches [AB09]'s read-write one remains formally unestablished,
per the waiver.

## Main results

* `Complexity.TuringMachine`-level combinators (all over the binary alphabet):
  `Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_id`, `Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_const`,
  `Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_comp`.

`M₂`'s input-head reads served from the intermediate tape and `M₂`'s emissions going to
the real output tape. Phase two costs constant overhead per step of `M₂`, which halts
within `T₂ |f x| ≤ T₂ (T₁ n)` steps. Bookkeeping (phase switching, boundary detection

# Oracle Turing machines

An oracle Turing machine [AB09, §3.4, Definition 3.4; pulled forward to Chapter 1 to
validate the model architecture] is a multi-tape machine with one additional designated
*query tape* and three designated states `qQuery`, `qYes`, `qNo`. Whenever the machine
enters `qQuery`, the string currently written on the query tape is submitted to the oracle
`O`: in a single step the machine moves to `qYes` if the query is in `O` and to `qNo`
otherwise, with all tapes and heads unchanged.

## Design

This file is the architectural test of the `Action`/`Action.apply` split: an oracle machine
reuses the configurations `Turing.Cfg (k + 1)` (the query tape is the extra work tape, at
index `Fin.last k`) and the action application of the plain model, and differs *only* in how
the next action is chosen — the step function is parametrized by the oracle
`O : Language Symbol`. Time and space measures therefore transfer unchanged.

Definitional choices worth auditing:

* **The query string** (`OracleTM.queryString`) is read from cell `0` of the query tape
  rightward up to (excluding) the first blank cell; if the whole nonnegative half-tape is
  blank-free (possible for an arbitrary configuration, though not for one reachable from an
  initial configuration), the query is defined to be `[]`. [AB09] leaves the extraction
  convention implicit; this is one concrete faithful reading.
* **The answer step** changes only the state; heads and tapes stay put. Some texts
  instead erase the query tape on each answer. The two conventions are equivalent up to
  *polynomial* overhead, but **not** constant overhead: computing the parity of `n`
  distinct length-`n` queries takes `O(n)` steps with a persistent tape and `Ω(n²)`
  steps with auto-erasure (`audits/phase1-findings.md`, finding 3, case 12).
  Consequently, exact `DTIME`-level bounds must never be transferred across this
  convention; class-level results (`Pᴼ` etc.) are unaffected.
* `qYes`/`qNo` are ordinary states from the machine's point of view (its transition
  function handles them); only `qQuery` triggers special behavior. The machine may query
  repeatedly. This reading presumes the three special states are pairwise distinct,
  which the raw structure does not enforce (e.g. with `qYes = qQuery` the machine
  re-queries forever after a positive answer): results at the faithful interface assume
  `OracleTM.WellFormed`. Note that
  `q₀ = qQuery` is legitimate and deliberately allowed (the machine then submits the
  empty query on its first step).

## Main definitions

* `Turing.OracleTM` — the oracle machine. [AB09, Definition 3.4]
* `Turing.OracleTM.WellFormed` — the three special states are pairwise distinct; the
  standing hypothesis of the faithful interface (oracle complexity classes will require
  it).
* `Turing.OracleTM.step`, `Turing.OracleTM.runFrom` — semantics relative to an oracle.
* `Turing.OracleTM.ComputesInTime` — output and time bound relative to an oracle.
* `Turing.Action.extend`, `Turing.Action.mapState`, `Turing.Cfg.embedOracle`,
  `Turing.OracleTM.ofMultiTapeTM` — the embedding of plain machines as oracle machines
  that never query.
* `Turing.OracleTM.plainEmptyOracle` — the converse direction: an oracle machine run
  with the empty oracle, as a plain `k + 1`-tape machine in exact lockstep.

## Main results (sanity checks for the architecture)

* `Turing.OracleTM.step_eq_of_ne_qQuery` — away from `qQuery`, the step does not depend
  on the oracle.
* `Turing.OracleTM.ofMultiTapeTM_wellFormed` — the embedding produces well-formed
  machines.
* `Turing.OracleTM.runFrom_ofMultiTapeTM` — an embedded plain machine runs in lockstep
  with the original, under every oracle.
* `Turing.OracleTM.computesInTime_ofMultiTapeTM` — hence its input/output behavior and
  time bounds are oracle-independent and agree with the plain machine's.
* `Turing.OracleTM.runFrom_plainEmptyOracle` — the empty-oracle elimination runs in
  exact lockstep.
* `Turing.OracleTM.queryString_length_le` — in an initialized run, the query after `t`
  steps has length at most `t`.
* `Turing.OracleTM.runFrom_workTapes_blank` — in an initialized run, cells at distance
  `≥ t` are still blank after `t` steps; the certificate that the no-blank fallback in
  `queryString` is unreachable from initialization.

/-- An oracle Turing machine with `k` ordinary work tapes, one query tape (the work tape
of index `Fin.last k` in its configurations `Cfg (k + 1)`), and designated query and
answer states. Finiteness of `State` is deferred exactly as for `MultiTapeTM`, and so is
distinctness of the three special states: the raw structure allows them to coincide
(with degenerate behavior, e.g. `qYes = qQuery` re-queries forever after a positive
answer), and the faithful interface imposes `OracleTM.WellFormed`.

/-- Well-formedness of an oracle machine: the query state and the two answer states are
pairwise distinct. Without this, the advertised semantics degenerates: with
`qYes = qQuery` a positive answer re-queries the unchanged tape forever (a negative
answer may still reach a distinct `qNo` and halt normally), and with all three states
collapsed the machine loops once the common query state is reached (an initial state
elsewhere can still halt via the table without ever querying). Moreover `qYes = qNo`
alone makes the step function — hence every run — oblivious to the oracle. This is the
standing hypothesis of the faithful oracle interface —
oracle complexity classes will require it. `q₀ = qQuery` is deliberately allowed: such a
machine simply submits the empty query on its first step.

# Bundled finite Turing machines

The raw model `Turing.MultiTapeTM k Symbol State` deliberately does not require `Symbol` or
`State` to be finite: semantics, simulations, and resource counting do not need it, and
compound state types arise freely in constructions. Finiteness is nevertheless
mathematically essential for complexity theory — with infinitely many states a machine can
memorize its whole input in the state and decide any language in linear time, and an
infinite transition table has no string encoding.

This file provides the bundled layer `Turing.FinTM`: a machine together with `Fintype` and
`DecidableEq` instances for its state type. All headline definitions of the Chapter 1
development (`DTIME`, `P`, machine encodings, the universal machine) are stated exclusively
over `FinTM`, so the finiteness hypothesis can never be dropped by accident. The instances
are carried as *data* (not `Finite` propositions) because the machine-encoding function
`⌞M⌟` must enumerate the transition table.

The alphabet parameter `Symbol` stays explicit and unbundled: the Chapter 1 headline
definitions fix `Symbol := Bool` (see `TCSlib.Complexity.ClassP.DTIME`), and results that
need a finite alphabet for a general `Symbol` take `[Fintype Symbol]` hypotheses at use
sites.

## Main definitions

* `Turing.FinTM Symbol` — a multi-tape TM over alphabet `Option Symbol` with a bundled
  finite state type. [AB09, §1.2]
* `Turing.FinTM.ComputesInTime` — the machine halts on `input` within `t` steps with
  `output` on the output tape (time-only variant of
  `Turing.MultiTapeTM.ComputesInTimeAndSpace`). [AB09, Definition 1.3]
* `Turing.FinTM.ComputesFunInTime` — the machine computes `f` in time `T`.
  [AB09, Definition 1.3]

## Main results

* `Turing.FinTM.ComputesInTime.mono` — halting is absorbing, so the time bound can be
  weakened.
* `Turing.FinTM.not_computesInTime_zero` — no machine computes anything in zero steps
  (the initial state is not the halting state).
* `Turing.MultiTapeTM.output_length_le`, `Turing.MultiTapeTM.output_prefix` — raw-layer
  output lemmas (at most one symbol is emitted per step, and output only grows), stated
  here rather than in the vendored `Deterministic.lean` to keep the vendored files
  unmodified.

# Deciding languages and the classes DTIME

Languages are sets of binary strings, `Mathlib`'s `Language Bool`. A bundled finite
machine over the binary alphabet (`Turing.FinTM Bool`, tape alphabet
`Option Bool = {0, 1, blank}`) *decides* a language `L` in time `T` if on every input `x`
it halts within `T |x|` steps with the single-symbol output `[true]` if `x ∈ L` and
`[false]` otherwise. `DTIME T` is the class of languages decided in time `c · T` for some
constant `c`. [AB09, §1.6, Definition 1.12]

## Design and deviations from [AB09]

* [AB09] fixes the four-symbol alphabet `{▷, □, 0, 1}` for the definition and remarks the
  choice is immaterial. Our machines use the three-symbol tape alphabet
  `Option Bool = {0, 1, blank}` over bidirectional tapes, which need no start symbol
  ([AB09, Claim 1.8] direction). The alphabet-reduction theorem ([AB09, Claim 1.5],
  phase 2) will show that machines over any finite alphabet are simulated by binary ones
  with a constant-factor slowdown — absorbed by the `∃ c` in `DTIME` — so defining
  `DTIME` over binary machines loses no generality.
* Acceptance is by output (`[true]`/`[false]`), not by accepting states: the vendored
  model has a single halting state and distinguishes outcomes by output, which [AB09]
  does via the output tape as well.
* **The output tape is append-only** (the transition emits at most one symbol per step,
  and emitted symbols cannot be erased), whereas [AB09, §1.2] designates a read-write
  work tape as the output tape — [AB09, p. 19] itself lists write-only output among the
  benign model variations. This bridge is **waived** (phase-2 audit, finding 3; see
  the plan's decision log): [AB09]'s read-write-output machine is not formalized in
  this development, so no simulation between the conventions is even statable; the
  compensating restriction is that no exact [AB09] step count is ever imported as a
  formal bound. The in-model buffer-and-flush technique lives in
  `TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Composition`.
* **Initialization differs from [AB09]**: there are no start-marker (`▷`) cells — the
  bidirectional tapes make them unnecessary — and the input head begins on the first
  input symbol (on the boundary blank for empty input), with all work tapes blank.
* The constant `c` ranges over all of `ℕ`; `c = 0` yields the bound `0`, within which no
  machine can halt (the initial state is not the halting state), so it contributes
  nothing — this matches [AB09]'s `c > 0` without carrying a positivity side condition.

## Main definitions

* `Turing.FinTM.DecidesInTime` — `M` decides `L` within time `T`. [AB09, §1.6 with
  Definition 1.3]
* `Complexity.DTIME` — the class of languages decidable in time `c · T`.
  [AB09, Definition 1.12]

## Main results

* `Complexity.DTIME.mono` — `DTIME` is monotone in the time bound.
* `Complexity.DTIME_eq_empty_of_exists_zero` — a time bound that vanishes at some
  length has an empty class (every machine needs at least one step to halt).

# The class P

`P` is the class of languages decidable in polynomial time: the union over `c` of
`DTIME (n^c + 1)`. [AB09, Definition 1.13, with the `+ 1` padding explained below —
every *positive*-degree component of the literal unpadded union is empty in this model,
since `n^c` vanishes at `n = 0` and no machine halts in zero steps; [AB09]'s union
ranges over `c ≥ 1`, so its literal reading is empty, while including degree `0` would
give exactly `DTIME 1` (in Lean `0 ^ 0 = 1`).]

## Design and deviations from [AB09]

* We take the union of `DTIME (fun n => n ^ c + 1)` over all `c : ℕ` where [AB09] writes
  `⋃_{c ≥ 1} DTIME(n^c)`. The `+ 1` repairs the empty-input degeneracy: a machine needs
  at least one step to halt, so for the degrees `d ≥ 1` of [AB09]'s union no language
  whatsoever is decided within `c · 0^d = 0` steps on the empty input, and the literal
  [AB09] definition would (vacuously) exclude even constant-time machines on that input. For `n ≥ 1` the bounds `c · (n^d + 1)` and
  `c' · n^d` sandwich each other, so this is the standard reading of the same class.
  Ranging over `c = 0` too is harmless: `n^0 + 1 = 2` is a constant bound, subsumed by
  larger `c`.

## Main definitions

* `Complexity.P` — [AB09, Definition 1.13].

## Main results

* `Complexity.dtime_poly_subset_P` — each `DTIME (n^c + 1)` is contained in `P`.
* `Complexity.mem_P_iff` — `P` is exactly the class decidable within `C · (n + 1) ^ d`
  for some constants, certifying that the `+ 1` padding has the conventional
  polynomial-time content.

# "And why it doesn't matter": model invariance of DTIME and P

The payoff of the robustness theorems ([AB09, §1.3.1], formalized in
`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Robustness`), stated at the strength the theorems
actually deliver (phase-2 audit, finding 4): **alphabet size** never matters —
`DTIME` is alphabet-invariant, the alphabet-dependent constant being absorbed by
`DTIME`'s own existential — while **the number of work tapes** does not matter *for
`P`*, where the quadratic overhead of tape reduction is harmless. No invariance of a
fixed class `DTIME T` under tape reduction is claimed, and [AB09, §1.6.1] likewise
draws only the polynomial-time conclusion. This is the formal content of the
chapter's title at class level.

## Main definitions

* `Turing.FinTM.DecidesInTimeVia` — a machine over a larger alphabet decides a binary
  language via a symbol embedding.

## Main results

* `Complexity.mem_DTIME_of_decidesInTimeVia` — deciding over any finite alphabet lands
  in binary `DTIME` (constant absorbed). [AB09, Claim 1.5 for languages]
* `Complexity.mem_P_of_decidesInTimeVia_poly` — `P` is alphabet-invariant.
* `Complexity.mem_P_iff_one_work_tape` — `P` is exactly what one-work-tape binary
  machines decide in polynomial time. [AB09, Claims 1.5-1.6 for `P`]

# Example: palindromes are decidable in linear time

The language `PAL` of binary palindromes is decidable in linear time, hence in `P`.
[AB09, Examples 1.1 and 1.4] This is the phase-1 sanity check that the model and class
definitions are *usable*: proving it requires constructing a concrete machine and running
the definitional semantics on it end to end.

## Deviations from [AB09]

* [AB09, Example 1.1] states "within `3n` steps". We state `PAL ∈ DTIME (n + 1)`: the
  `∃ c` in `DTIME` absorbs the leading constant, and the `+ 1` covers the empty input, on
  which every machine needs at least one step to halt (`3 · 0 = 0` is unachievable — the
  book ignores this degenerate case).

## Main definitions

* `Complexity.PAL` — the palindrome language. [AB09, Example 1.1]

## Main results

* `Complexity.PAL_mem_DTIME_linear` — `PAL ∈ DTIME (n + 1)`. [AB09, Example 1.4]
* `Complexity.PAL_mem_P` — `PAL ∈ P`.

/-- Palindromes are decidable in linear time. [AB09, Examples 1.1 and 1.4]

**Proof sketch.** Adapt the machine of [AB09, Example 1.1] to our model (bidirectional
tapes, no start symbol, blank = `none`): a one-work-tape machine with states
`{copy, rewind, test}`.

1. *Copy* (`n + 1` steps): move the input head and the work head right in unison, copying
   each input symbol to the work tape, until the input head reads blank (one cell past the
   input). The work head now sits one cell right of the copied string.
2. *Rewind* (`n + 1` steps): move the input head left back to the left boundary cell while
   the work head stays put; then step the work head one cell left onto the last symbol.
3. *Test* (`n + 1` steps): move the input head right and the work head left in unison,
   comparing the input symbol against the work symbol. On a mismatch, emit `false` and
   halt. When the input head reads blank again (all positions matched), emit `true` and
   halt.

Each phase takes at most `n + 1` steps, so some constant `c` (e.g. `c = 4`) gives
`c · (n + 1) ≥ 3n + 3` total steps, witnessing the `DTIME (n + 1)` bound. The formal
proof constructs the machine's transition function explicitly and establishes the
three-phase invariants by induction on the step count. -/

# Time-constructible functions

A function `T : ℕ → ℕ` is *time constructible* if `T n ≥ n` and some machine computes,
on every input `x`, the binary representation of `T |x|` within at most
`c · (T |x| + 1)` steps for a positive constant `c`. [AB09, §1.3, with the audit-mandated
budget repair below.] Time constructibility rules out pathological time bounds. It is
needed when a machine must *generate* a step budget from its input length, as in the
hierarchy theorems; note that the timed universal machine of [AB09, p. 21] receives its
budget as an explicit extra input and needs no constructibility hypothesis.

## Design and deviations from [AB09]

* Binary representation is `Nat.bits` (little-endian, no leading `false`s), where [AB09]
  writes `⌞T(|x|)⌟` without fixing endianness. Nothing in Chapter 1 depends on the choice.
* **Deviation (audit-mandated).** [AB09] demands the computation run within exactly
  `T n` steps and then asserts that `n`, `n log n`, `n²`, `2ⁿ` are time constructible.
  The phase-1 external audit (`audits/phase1-findings.md`, finding 1, adversarial cases
  5-6) *proved the literal reading false in this model*: under the exact bound, the
  identity function — [AB09]'s own first example — is not time constructible (on the
  budget `T n = n`, the first transition on `[false]` and `[false, false]` is the same
  function call, and the length-1 budget forces it to halt with output `[true]`, which
  absorption then freezes at length 2), and even `T n = n + 1` fails by an append-only
  prefix argument. We therefore allow a positive constant factor on `T n + 1`, which
  suffices for every downstream use and restores the book's examples *after small-input
  normalization*: the literal `n · ⌈log₂ n⌉`, for instance, still violates `T n ≥ n` at
  `n = 1`, so such examples are stated with a `max`-with-`n` or `+ 1` normalization.
  Exact constants in downstream results must be derived from this form, not inherited
  from the strict reading.

## Main definitions

* `Complexity.TimeConstructible` — [AB09, §1.3], with the constant-slack repair above.

## Main results

* `Complexity.timeConstructible_id` — the identity function is time constructible,
  restoring [AB09]'s example under the repaired definition.

first `false`/blank cell, which becomes `true`, then returning to cell 0). Incrementing
`n` times costs amortized `O(1)` per increment, `O(n)` in total. When the input head
reads the blank past the input, the machine walks the counter left to right emitting
each bit to the output tape (`O(log n)` steps) and halts. The total is at most
`c · (n + 1)` steps for an absolute constant `c`, and the emitted string is `n.bits`
(for `n = 0` the counter region is empty and nothing is emitted, matching
`Nat.bits 0 = []`). -/

# Alphabet reduction

[AB09, Claim 1.5]: a machine over any finite alphabet `Γ` is simulated by a machine
over the binary alphabet with only a constant-factor slowdown (the constant depending
on `|Γ|`), and with the same number of work tapes. This is the theorem that justifies
defining `DTIME` over binary-alphabet machines (see
`TCSlib.Complexity.ClassP.DTIME`).

## Deviations from [AB09]

* [AB09] states the slowdown as `4 log |Γ| · T(n)`; we existentialize the constant and
  pad with `+ 1` (empty input), consistently with the rest of the development.
* [AB09]'s statement fixes input and output over `{0,1}` with only the *work* alphabet
  reduced. In our model a machine has one alphabet for all tapes, so "computing a
  binary function" for a `Γ`-machine is expressed via a symbol embedding `e : Bool ↪ Γ`
  (`Turing.FinTM.ComputesFunInTimeVia`): the simulator reads genuine binary input
  directly (its table composes with `e`), block-encodes work-tape symbols in
  `⌈log₂ |Γ|⌉` bits, and decodes each emitted symbol `e b` back to the bit `b`.
  Emitted symbols are always in the range of `e` because the append-only output equals
  the final output string, which is `(f x).map e` — early emissions included, since an
  irrevocable emission remains a prefix of the final output.
* [AB09]'s Claim 1.5 hypothesizes a time-constructible `T`; the simulation does not
  need it, so we drop the hypothesis. The statement also generalizes Boolean output to
  string output.

## Main results

* `Turing.FinTM.alphabet_reduction` — [AB09, Claim 1.5].

/-- **Alphabet reduction** [AB09, Claim 1.5]: if a machine over a finite alphabet `Γ`
computes the binary string function `f` via `e : Bool ↪ Γ` within time `T`, then a
binary-alphabet machine with the *same number of work tapes* computes `f` within
`c · (T n + 1)` for some constant `c` (depending on the original machine).

**Proof sketch.** Fix a binary block code of length `L = ⌈log₂ |Γ|⌉` for `Option Γ`'s
non-blank symbols. `M'` keeps each of `M`'s work tapes as a block-encoded tape. One
step of `M` is simulated by: reading the `L` bits under each work head into the state
(`L` steps per tape, walking right), reading the input bit directly (its `e`-image is
determined by the table), computing `M`'s transition inside the finite state, writing
back the `L`-bit codes while returning left (`L` steps per tape), moving each head `L`
cells in the simulated direction, and emitting the decoded bit whenever `M` emits.
Total: at most `c` steps of `M'` per step of `M` with `c = O((k + 1) · L)` — the
`+ 1` covering the input-read, state-update, and emission work that remains even for
`k = 0` — plus a constant start-up. Logical blank is represented by the all-blank (`none`-cell) block — never-
visited blocks already have this shape, so no binary code needs reserving and no
initialization pass is required (phase-2 audit, finding 8). The invariant
relating block-encoded configurations to `M`'s configurations is preserved by each
simulated step, and `M`'s halting transfers. -/

# Reduction to one work tape

[AB09, Claim 1.6]: `k` work tapes are simulated by a single work tape with a quadratic
slowdown.

## Deviations from [AB09]

* [AB09]'s Claim 1.6 merges input, work, *and output* into one single tape (the
  standard model of Sipser's text). Our model structurally always has a separate
  read-only input tape and write-only output tape, so the faithful in-model rendering
  is **one work tape**: the interesting content — interleaving `k` tapes on one, with
  marked head positions and full sweeps — is identical, while the merged-single-tape
  model itself is out of scope (it is a different structure, not an instance of
  `MultiTapeTM`).
* [AB09] states the slowdown as `5k T(n)²`; we existentialize the constant and use
  `(T n + 1)²`.
* The retained structure is a genuinely different model from [AB09]'s merged one, not
  a notational variant: with a separate input tape, palindromes are decidable in
  linear time (`TCSlib.Complexity.ClassP.Examples`), while the merged single-tape
  model has an `Ω(n²)` lower bound for them ([AB09], chapter notes, citing Maass).
  Accordingly, the theorems below are *in-model analogues* of Claim 1.6, and no
  identification with the merged model is claimed anywhere in this development
  (phase-2 audit, finding 5).

## Main results

* `Turing.FinTM.one_work_tape` — [AB09, Claim 1.6] over an enlarged alphabet.
* `Turing.FinTM.one_work_tape_binary` — combined with alphabet reduction
  ([AB09, Claim 1.5]): one work tape *and* binary alphabet, still quadratic.

/-- **One work tape suffices** [AB09, Claim 1.6]: a `Γ`-machine computing `f` within
`T` is simulated by a machine with a single work tape, over an enlarged finite
alphabet, within `c · (T n + 1)²`.

**Proof sketch.** For `k = 0`, simulate `M` directly with one unused work tape.
For `k ≥ 1`, the single work tape of `M'` stores the `k` tapes of `M` interleaved:
cell `j·k + i` of the simulated layout holds cell `j` of tape `i` (centered at `0` in
both directions). The alphabet is enlarged to cells carrying a *tagged payload*
`Option Γ` — so a marked blank is representable, which a bare `Γ × flag` product
would miss — together with a "head here" flag and zone-boundary tags; `Γ` embeds via
`e` as an unmarked non-blank payload. To simulate one step of `M`, `M'` sweeps its work tape once
left-to-right across the visited zone recording the `k` marked symbols in its state,
computes `M`'s transition, and sweeps back right-to-left updating the marked cells and
moving the marks. After `t` steps of `M` the visited zone spans `O(k · (t + 1))`
cells, so each simulated step costs `O(k · (T n + 1))` and the total is
`c · (T n + 1)²`. Input reads and output emissions pass through unchanged. -/

# Bidirectional versus unidirectional tapes

[AB09, Claim 1.8]: tapes that are infinite in both directions are simulated by tapes
infinite in one direction only, with constant-factor slowdown.

## Deviations from [AB09]

Our vendored model's tapes are *already* bidirectional (`ℤ`-indexed) — that choice is
what lets initialization dispense with start markers. So the faithful in-model
rendering of Claim 1.8 runs in the only meaningful direction: every machine is
simulated, with constant-factor slowdown and the same number of work tapes, by one
whose work heads **never visit a negative cell** (`Turing.FinTM.NonnegativeHeads`),
i.e. by a machine that uses its tapes unidirectionally. The simulating machine "folds"
each tape at the origin, following [AB09]'s proof, over the enlarged non-blank
alphabet `Bool × Option Γ × Option Γ` — an origin flag plus two *independent*,
possibly blank, payloads. (A bare `Γ × Γ` cannot represent a symbol paired with a
blank neighbor; phase-2 re-audit, finding 1.)

## Main results

* `Turing.FinTM.NonnegativeHeads` — the unidirectional-use predicate.
* `Turing.FinTM.nonnegative_heads` — [AB09, Claim 1.8].

within `T` is simulated, with the same number of work tapes and constant-factor
slowdown, by a machine over an enlarged alphabet whose work heads never visit negative
cells.

**Proof sketch.** Fold each tape at the origin along the coordinate
`φ z = if 0 ≤ z then z else -z - 1` (note `φ 0 = φ (-1) = 0`; this is *not* the
absolute value): physical cell `p ≥ 0` holds the two *independent* payloads —
simulated cell `p` and simulated cell `-p - 1`, each possibly blank — over the
enlarged non-blank alphabet `Γ' = Bool × Option Γ × Option Γ`, whose Boolean
component is an origin flag; `e γ = (false, some γ, none)` (injective via its first
payload), and an untouched physical blank decodes as two blanks with no flag. The
simulator's state tracks, per tape, which component the simulated head is in. Because
a transition cannot read a head coordinate, the origin is made *detectable* by a
fresh initialization state whose single action writes `(true, none, none)` at cell
`0` of every work tape simultaneously (one transition, length-independent); every
later write updates only the active payload, preserving the other payload and the
flag. Moves translate directly except at the fold: crossing between simulated cells `0`
and `-1` flips the component *without* issuing a physical move (the physical
coordinate stays `0`); each simulated step costs a constant number of physical steps,
giving `c · (T n + 1)` — [AB09] gets `4T`. Physical head positions are values of `φ`,
hence nonnegative; on enlarged-alphabet inputs containing symbols outside the range
of `e` — where no functional behavior is promised but `NonnegativeHeads` still
quantifies — the simulator halts safely on first contact, preserving nonnegativity
(phase-2 audit, finding 10 and case A14). The folding invariant transfers computation
and halting on embedded inputs. -/

# Oblivious machines

A machine is *oblivious* if its head movements depend only on the input length, not on
the input itself [AB09, Remark 1.7 and Exercise 1.5]. Obliviousness will matter for
the Cook-Levin theorem (Chapter 2), where the tableau of an oblivious computation has
input-independent structure.

## Design

* Configurations are indexed by their input, so head positions of runs on different
  inputs live in different types only for the input head; obliviousness compares
  `Fin`-valued input positions through `ℕ` and work positions (in `ℤ`) directly.
* `Oblivious` constrains *represented* head trajectories only — the input head and
  the work heads. Our model has no output-head position (output is an append-only
  stream), so emission schedules are deliberately unconstrained; [AB09]'s read-write
  output head is covered by this reading only via a bridge, e.g. a machine that emits
  once at a fixed final time, as the decider produced below does.
* `Oblivious` does **not** imply that the halting time is determined by the input
  length: heads freeze on halting, but frozen positions can coincidentally agree — a
  stationary-head machine can halt after one or two steps depending on its first
  input bit while satisfying `Oblivious` (phase-2 audit, finding 1, with an explicit
  counterexample in `audits/phase2-findings.md`). The `TimeConstructible` hypothesis
  below is required by the *construction* (the simulator derives a length-determined
  step budget and pads its schedule to it), not forced by the definition. If a
  downstream use (the Cook-Levin tableau, Ch. 2) needs length-determined halting or a
  simultaneous one-work-tape oblivious normal form (`M.k = 1 ∧ M.Oblivious`), those
  are separate conjuncts for that normal-form theorem.
* We state the quadratic version — Exercise 1.5's *first assertion*, adapted to this
  model; the exercise's final two-tape normal form is **not** included here. The
  `O(T log T)` sharpening (Exercise 1.6) is a stretch goal alongside §1.7, off the
  critical path.

## Main definitions

* `Turing.FinTM.Oblivious` — [AB09, Remark 1.7].

## Main results

* `Complexity.oblivious_of_mem_DTIME` — [AB09, Exercise 1.5]: every language decidable
  in time-constructible time `T` is decided by an oblivious machine in `O((T + 1)²)`.

/-- **Oblivious simulation** — the first assertion of [AB09, Exercise 1.5], adapted
to this model: for time-constructible `T`, every language in `DTIME T` is decided by
an *oblivious* machine within `c · (T n + 1)²`. (The exercise's additional two-tape
normal form is not part of this statement.)

**Proof sketch** (corrected per the phase-2 audit, finding 2: the construction must
not invoke `one_work_tape_binary` per simulated step — that composes quadratics into
a quartic — must not run the constructibility witness verbatim, which need not be
oblivious, and must park the real input head). Take a decider for `L` within
`a · T n` and a constructibility witness within `b · (T n + 1)`.

1. Run the witness with every non-blank input symbol *read as `false`* (substituted
   in its transition table): its entire run — trajectories, emissions, halting time —
   then coincides with its run on the all-`false` input of length `n`, hence depends
   only on `n`, and it still computes `⌞T n⌟`; store the budget on a work tape.
2. Copy the real input to a work tape in one fixed scan and rewind (cost
   `O(n + 1)`, absorbed since `n ≤ T n`), then park the real input head for good.
3. Set `B n = (a + 1) · (T n + 1)` macrosteps and prepare a marked layout of size
   `O(B n)` holding the decider's work tapes, the virtual input copy, virtual head
   markers, and a step counter.
4. Each macrostep simulates one step of the decider by a fixed number of full sweeps
   of the layout — tape data affects writes, simulated state, and markers, never the
   sweep path or its duration — idling identically once the simulated machine halts,
   for exactly `B n` macrosteps (counter maintenance within the per-macrostep linear
   allowance; fixed-duration binary block coding throughout, so no appeal to the
   existential `alphabet_reduction` is needed to stay binary and oblivious).
5. Emit the stored answer bit at a fixed final time and halt.

Every head trajectory and the halting time are then functions of `n` and `t` alone,
and the total cost is `O(b · (T n + 1) + (B n)²) = O((T n + 1)²)`. -/

# Configurations of Multi-Tape Turing Machines

Configurations of a multi-tape Turing machine with a read-only input tape, `k` work tapes and one
write-only output tape, together with what a single transition does to one and the space measure
read off a list of them.

## Design

Nothing here mentions a machine. A step is described in two parts: an `Action`, recording
which way the input head moves, what is written and where the work heads move, which symbol is
emitted and which state follows; and `Action.apply`, which carries it out on a
configuration.

The output tape is part of the configuration, so the string emitted along a run can be read off
the configuration the run ends in.

## Main definitions

* `Cfg`: the configuration: the internal state, the tape contents and head positions, and the
    output tape
* `Action`: what a machine does in one step
* `Action.apply`: the effect of one action on a configuration
* `Cfg.Halted`, `Cfg.init`: halting, and the configuration a machine starts in
* `spaceUsedOfCfgs`: work tape cells touched along a list of configurations

# Deterministic Multi-Tape Turing Machines

Defines deterministic Turing machines with a read-only input tape, `k` work tapes and one
write-only output tape.
The tapes contain symbols from `Option Symbol` for a finite alphabet `Symbol` (where `none` is the
blank symbol).

## Design

The multi-tape Turing machine uses a read-only input tape, `k` work tapes and a write-only output
tape.
The input head can move freely on the input, but any move attempt beyond one cell outside the input
results in no movement.
The transition function can optionally output one symbol, which models the write-only output tape.
Because of these restrictions, we ignore the input and output tapes for space usage of the machine.
The space usage is defined as the total number of cells the work tape heads visited during
execution.

Restricting the movement of the input head is not essential, but useful because it allows
us to easily bound the number of possible configurations of a space-bounded machine. Most textbooks
have this restriction.

Instead of considering the cells _visited_ by the work tape heads, some textbooks
(including [AB09]) only consider the number of cells that contain
a non-blank symbol at some point in the execution or the number of cells written to. This allows
work tape heads to freely move at no cost as long as they do not write. It is
important to note that this causes `DSPACE(1)` to include `DSPACE(log log n)`, a class that
contains e.g. the non-regular language `{0^n 1^n | n ∈ ℕ}` (it is accepted by a TM that writes a
single marker on the work tape and then counts the number of symbols by work tape head movement
without writing).
Defining space usage via "cells visited" thus yields the more fine-grained "complexity world" in
which `DSPACE(1)` is exactly the class of regular languages.

This definition is adapted from the one in [Pap94], chapter 2.3 including
the sub-linear space modifications from chapter 2.5 with the following changes:
- We allow Turing machines to choose to not write on a tape. This is equivalent to
  writing the read symbol again but makes it easier to reason about the semantics.
- Our tapes are infinite in both directions instead of just to the right. This definition is
  equivalent (see [AB09], Claim 1.8). It saves us from having to add a "start marker" to
  the alphabet.
- We only have a single halting state. The different ways to halt (accepting, rejecting, etc) can
  be distinguished based on the output.
- The way to prevent the input head to move outside the input is enforced by the interpretation
  and not by a restriction on the transition function. The two definitions are equivalent, but
  not restricting the transition function makes it easier to define a universal machine.

## Main definitions

We define a number of structures and concepts related to multi-tape Turing machine computation:

* `MultiTapeTM`: the TM itself

A multi-tape Turing machine with `k` work tapes over the alphabet of `Option Symbol` (where `none`
is the blank tape symbol). Note that it is not required that `Symbol` or `State` are finite
to keep the definition more general. The restriction will be introduced once we start talking about
computability by Turing machines in general.
