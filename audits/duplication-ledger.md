# Cumulative duplication ledger

The standing per-file accounting of copied proved material that
`workflow.md` §4 requires at every epoch boundary. Created as the
retrofit-R1 round-1 repair (R1-2); **rebuilt at round 2** (R2-1/R2-2 of
`audits/retrofit-r1-r2-findings.md`): the first version's arithmetic was
inconsistent (summands 261 against a printed 249), its inclusion rule was
applied asymmetrically, and it **misclassified an exact three-file copy
family as "design-harvest reimplementation"** — the round-2 auditor
proved the four relocation declarations byte-identical across `Loop`,
`Primitives`, and `Hardness` after consistent identifier substitution,
and found the 13 exact Loop-internal H3 copies omitted. This version
adopts one inclusion rule, enumerates every family, and uses the
auditor's independently computed figures wherever they exist.

## Counting convention (one rule)

**Primary rule — expanded correspondence membership**: a declaration is a
ledger member iff it belongs to a *recorded cross-declaration
correspondence* — the retrofit inventories' twin maps **including their
strengthened-counterpart rows**, the A2/F2A reports' declared copies, and
the round-2 audit's verified relocation and H3 families. Each member is
counted **once per file it inhabits**. (Secondary, where it differs: the
*strict normalized-byte-twin* count excludes the five strengthened
counterparts — Loop's `loopHost_prepare`/`loopHost_contracts`,
Primitives' `splitSolve_of_body`/`_source`/`_closed` — and H3's one
near-copy `_init` pair.) Fractions are members over the file's total
declarations. Line figures use the round-2 audit's span rule — attached
docstring and intervening closure note through the last code line,
excluding separating blank/module-note blocks — with the auditor's
computed values where available and estimates under the same rule marked
`≈`.

**Reconciliation notes (rounds 3-4 repairs)**: the F2A report's 306
inventory entries decompose as **150 Primitives + 94 Loop + 10 Wrappers +
3 Composition copies + 20 counter members + 2 in-file originals + 7
adaptations (`f2_strip_linear`, `f2_counter_heads`, round 5;
`f2_counter_count_space`, `f2_exists_loopFind_space`, `f2_cond_time`,
`f2_rewind_heads`, `f2_cond_ledger`, round 6) + 20 nonmembers** (the
round-4 correction: the old "29 outside" wrongly included the two counted
in-file originals); the 20 share no member-level material with any
declaration of the five source files (round-6 exhaustive screen below) (the `f2_polyHeads`/`f2_space_of_time`/
`f2_segment_heads`-class engines and strengthenings — round-4 sampled and
accepted). The A2 report's 45 declarations contribute 2 in-file copies +
`a2_loop_halted_run` (in the Loop 95) + **13 cross-file adaptations**
(round-6 screen) + 29 new constructions. Catalog's union:
`318 = 286 F2A + 16 A2 + 7 earlier redirect + 9 public counterparts`.

**The public-proof screen (round-5 repair of R4-1; R5-1/R5-2/R5-3).**
Published as `audits/evidence/retrofit/r1-public-proof-screen.py` with its
output `r1-public-proof-screen.out`. *Erratum:* the round-4 run tested
whether a source proof was contained **whole** in its counterpart, but the
round-4 text described "segments ≥ 60 characters". The round-5 auditor ran
the method as described and found six fragment hits that the containment
test could not see. The method below is the one actually run.

- **Method.** Strip comments and all whitespace. Rename each source
  identifier `h` to `f2_h` wherever Catalog declares `f2_h` (dotted names
  split). Report two measures:
  - the **longest common contiguous segment** (LCS), with the literal ≥ 60
    candidate threshold;
  - the **shared length**: greedy string tiling with blocks of at least 25
    characters, as a fraction of the **source** proof.
- **Rule.** A pair is a **member** when at least half of the source proof
  reappears in the target, with an absolute floor of 60 shared characters
  so that a one-line citation of a public lemma counts as reuse. Any other
  shared tiling of at least 60 characters is a recorded **fragment**, not
  counted. The rest are citations or no match.
- **Population (R5-3).** 17 eligible pairs: 2 from Composition (`id`,
  `const`) and **15** from Primitives, not the 16 stated in round 4. Five
  source theorems have no `_spaceUsed` counterpart: `ifEq`, `comp`,
  `splitSolveWith`, `unaryToken`, `appendBit`.
- **Pass 1, direct pairs.**
  - Members (7): `id` 96.5%, `const` 97.1%, `prepend` 93.9%,
    `pairEncodeFixed` 100%, `pairFst`/`pairSnd` 88.8%, `pairConcat`
    88.7%.
  - Fragments, recorded and not counted (3): `polyUnary` (119 characters
    shared, 46.7%); `pairLenCheck` (305, 21.9%; its LCS is the 91-character
    `Nat.pow_one` bound); `stripLast` (221, 11.7%; its LCS is the
    121-character `have hn` weakening).
  - Citations or no match (7): `lengthBits`, `polyBits`, `pairValid`,
    `pairDup`, `pairMapSnd`, `splitSolve` (the auditor's 27-character
    citation), `incFixed`.
  - The literal ≥ 60 LCS screen reproduces the auditor's hit set exactly
    (`id` 776, `const` 273, and 62/75/75/75/91/121 for the six Primitives
    pairs). One member falls below the 60-character LCS threshold:
    `pairEncodeFixed`, whose longest block is 53 characters but whose whole
    91-character source proof reappears. This is why the rule measures
    coverage, not contiguity alone.
- **Pass 2, residual helpers.** Each of the 27 nonmembers recorded in
  round 4 is screened against every public proof of Composition,
  Primitives and TimeConstructible, taking the best match by shared length.
  - Members (2): `f2_strip_linear` (86.0% of `computesFunInTime_stripLast`;
    R5-1) and `f2_counter_heads` (64.1% of `timeConstructible_id`; the
    auditor's 215-character partial-reuse candidate, which crosses the
    member bar once measured by tiling).
  - Fragments, recorded (6): `f2_counter_count_space` 6.5%,
    `f2_unary_sharp` 35.7%, `f2_cond_time` 30.0% (vs
    `bufferedCompTM_computesInTime`, a candidate the auditor did not list),
    `f2_rewind_scan_heads` 7.4%, `f2_rewind_heads` 6.0%,
    `f2_cond_ledger` 11.7%.
  - The remaining 19 share under 60 characters with any public proof.
- **Round-6 repair (R6-1, R6-5): pass 3, exhaustive.** Round 6 found
  R6-1, which the public-only residual pass could not see. Pass 3 replaces
  that scope limit. **Every one of Catalog's 124 non-members** (all of
  Catalog minus the post-R6-1 299-member union, computed by name in the
  script) is screened against **every declaration, public and private, of
  Composition, Primitives, TimeConstructible, Loop and Wrappers** (530
  declarations). An exact 25-character prefilter is used; it loses nothing,
  because every tile is at least 25 characters. Verdicts compare like with
  like, proof with proof and term with term, so a proof that spells out a
  definition's term is reported as a restatement and not counted. **Every**
  qualifying pair is printed, not just each target's best match (R6-5).
  - Result: **19 cross-file members**, all counted in the Catalog row
    above, with 6 new source-side members (Primitives 1, Loop 4, Wrappers
    1).
  - Five A2 members reproduce just over half of one 129-character Loop
    proof, `emLoop_run_prefix`. They are counted, as the rule requires,
    and flagged as low-coverage.
- **Standing in-file convention, stated explicitly.** Pass 3b lists
  in-file near-duplicates among the non-members: 109 pairs over 62
  targets. Thirteen exceed 90%, and they are led by the §12 sibling
  machine rows (`transferTM` against `copyTM` 99.8%, and the
  clear/compare/increment rows), which are public constructions audited at
  the §12 and F1 gates. Per the ledger's standing convention, which counts
  in-file **exact** copies (the H3 thirteen, the `a2_mapSumEquiv`/
  `a2_map_sum` pair) and **notes in-file near-duplicates without counting
  them**, they are recorded, not counted. None is an exact copy. Their
  disposition is the 12.2c per-theme split, which factors these families.
- **Coverage qualification.** The screen covers the five source files of
  Catalog's copy families, in full, at the stated thresholds. Copies from
  files outside those families, or adaptations restructured below the
  25-character tile size, are outside it.

Copy-side counts deliberately include copies whose originals were deleted
in R1 (the copies persist; deletion of an original does not shrink the
copy side). The Loop inventory's recorded dispositions — the 8 dead
Loop-twin copies in Catalog (`f2_loop_silent_prefix`,
`f2_loopBody_capture`, the six `f2_loopDebit*`/`f2_loopBorrow*`) and the
orphans' dead twins — are **dispositions for 12.2c, not subtractions
here**; sole-owner/dead labels require Catalog's reference graph and are
settled at that window. Internal near-duplicates flagged by the
inventories but outside the rule (`clCountTape ≡ bufferTape`, the H3
`_init` pair) are noted, uncounted.

**Epoch R1 delta**: new copies **0**; the historical maps lost **eleven
dead originals plus one live original eliminated by replacement**
(`catalogPair_inverse`, the human-approved E1) — 245 → 233 surviving
→Catalog originals (R2-3 wording); net −1,639 lines, −83 private
declarations (76 dead + 7 replaced).

## Watch items (design-parallel, no byte-copies)

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| **ch7 EmitIter layer vs the §12 layer** (merged with PR #11, 2026-10-10): `Build/EmitIterEmbed.lean` exports a **public** tape-padding, state-injecting embedding layer (`padAction`/`embedCfg`/`embed_step`/`embed_run`/`SafeRun` — 18 public declarations, none private; *corrected 2026-10-10: the first version of this row called them private*), written against main (which lacks `Build/Embed.lean`) and structurally parallel to the §12 bank-embedding transformers; the emit-iteration host (`Build/EmitIterBody.lean`, 1 public, 17 private) parallels the §12/Loop host family. **Body-level screen** (`audits/evidence/ch7/ch7-fill-duplication-screen.md`; the first version of this row rested on a name screen alone): **no copies of pre-existing repository material** — none of the §12 or loop-library material matches; the ch7 modules consume main's public `exists_emitLoopTM`/`exists_emitCallTM`/`exists_installCallTM` rows by citation. This row is design duplication; the stack's own copy family is ledgered below. | **12.2c docket** (user, 2026-10-10): harmonize to one embedding layer and one host family at the per-theme split; the naming of the shared block primitive is settled there too. The ch7 fill gate (`audits/ch7-fill-pack.md`, run on the merged tree; question 7) compares the two layers as facts. Consumption embargo until that gate closes. |

Any new copy in a future delivery enters through the per-delivery ledger
and the one-fifth escalation rule of `workflow.md` §4.
