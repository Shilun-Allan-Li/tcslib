# External audit pack — Phase 2 (robustness, composition, model invariance)

Audits the phase-2 skeleton at commit `2917a1b9` on `complexity/arora-barak-ch1`:
Claims 1.5/1.6/1.8, oblivious machines, composition combinators, and the class-level
model-invariance corollaries — all statement-first, 11 new `sorry`s (28 total), every
file elaborating with zero errors. Phase 1 closed its audit loop
(`audits/phase1-resolutions.md`); this pack opens phase 2's. Record findings in
`audits/phase2-findings.md`.

## Brief for the auditor

Same ground rules as the phase-1 rounds: you audit the trusted surface — definitions,
theorem statements, remaining `sorry`s, and declared deviations — not tactic scripts.
Failure modes: infidelity to [AB09], trivialization, unprovability as literally
stated, missing hypotheses. For every **new** definition and theorem (listed below):
restate it in your own mathematical English before reading its docstring, compare
against the cited [AB09] location, and report daylight. For every new `sorry`: argue
in 2-5 sentences why it is true as literally stated, or exhibit the problem. Attempt
at least **5 adversarial instantiations**. Do not give a blanket approval.

New surface under audit: `Turing.FinTM.ComputesFunInTimeVia` (added to `Finite.lean`);
all of `Composition.lean` (`computesFunInTime_id`, `computesFunInTime_const`,
`computesFunInTime_comp`); all of `Robustness/` (`alphabet_reduction`;
`one_work_tape`, `one_work_tape_binary`; `NonnegativeHeads`, `nonnegative_heads`;
`Oblivious`, `oblivious_of_mem_DTIME`); all of `ClassP/ModelInvariance.lean`
(`DecidesInTimeVia`, `mem_DTIME_of_decidesInTimeVia`, `mem_P_of_decidesInTimeVia_poly`,
`mem_P_iff_one_work_tape`). Everything else is unchanged since the closed phase-1
loop; spot-check rather than re-audit.

## Declared in-model renderings (the main audit target — judge their faithfulness)

Chapter 1's robustness claims are stated by [AB09] across *different machine models*;
our formalization has one model, so each claim is rendered inside it. These renderings
are decisions the audit should explicitly endorse or reject:

1. **Claim 1.5 (alphabet).** "Machine over finite `Γ` computing a binary function" is
   expressed via a symbol embedding (`ComputesFunInTimeVia e`, inputs `x.map e`,
   outputs `(f x).map e`), because our model has one alphabet for all tapes while
   [AB09] keeps input/output binary and reduces only the work alphabet. The simulator
   preserves the number of work tapes.
2. **Claim 1.6 (single tape).** Rendered as **one work tape** (`M'.k = 1`), keeping
   the structural read-only input and write-only output tapes. [AB09]'s merged
   input/work/output single-tape machine is a *different structure*, not an instance
   of `MultiTapeTM`, and is declared out of scope.
3. **Claim 1.8 (bidirectional).** Our tapes are already `ℤ`-indexed, so the rendering
   is: every machine is simulated by one whose work heads never visit negative cells
   (`NonnegativeHeads`), via [AB09]'s folding construction.
4. **Obliviousness.** Defined as: head positions at every time `t` agree across
   same-length inputs. Because halting freezes heads, this forces oblivious machines
   to halt at length-determined times — hence the `TimeConstructible` hypothesis in
   the Exercise 1.5 statement. Output-emission times are *not* constrained, only head
   positions, matching [AB09]'s wording.
5. **Convention obligations from phase 1, finding 4** (dispositions to assess):
   the append-only vs read-write output-tape simulation is discharged by
   `Composition.lean`'s buffer-and-flush construction plus documentation, on the
   stated ground that no exact step count is ever imported from [AB09] (every bound
   in the development carries an existential constant). The persistent-vs-erased
   query-tape polynomial-overhead statement is deferred to the Chapter 3 oracle-class
   work, where polynomial overhead is meaningful. Both decisions are recorded in the
   plan's decision log.

## Specific questions

1. `ComputesFunInTimeVia`: is anything lost relative to [AB09]'s formulation — e.g. a
   `Γ`-machine whose *input* uses symbols outside `e`'s range, or the fact that `e`
   need not hit [AB09]'s designated `{0,1} ⊆ Γ`? Is `∀ x : List α` over *all* binary
   strings the right quantifier for the corollaries drawn from it?
2. `alphabet_reduction`: verify the claim survives with `M'.k = M.k` (the block-code
   simulation needs no extra tape?), and that the emitted-symbols-in-range argument
   (append-only output equals the final output) is airtight — including inputs `x`
   where the machine emits *before* it could know the input.
3. `one_work_tape` / `one_work_tape_binary`: is the quadratic bound `c · (T n + 1)²`
   correct for the interleaved-with-marks layout ([AB09] says `5k T(n)²`), including
   the visited-zone-growth argument? Does the binary corollary's constant composition
   `c₂ · (c₁ · (T n + 1)² + 1) ≤ c · (T n + 1)²` hold for all `n` (note `T ≥ 0`,
   `(T n + 1)² ≥ 1`)?
4. `nonnegative_heads`: is `NonnegativeHeads` (initialized runs only) the right
   unidirectionality predicate, or should it constrain arbitrary configurations? Check
   the folding simulation preserves `k` and that a work head parked at `0` moving left
   (clamped in [AB09]'s unidirectional model, a real move in ours) causes no
   infidelity in this simulation direction.
5. `Oblivious`: does the definition have the intended extension — e.g. is the
   frozen-heads argument correct that oblivious machines halt at length-determined
   times, or can a machine halt at input-dependent times with coincidentally agreeing
   frozen positions and still be `Oblivious`? If the latter, does any planned use
   (Cook-Levin tableaux) need the stronger "halting time is a function of length"?
   Should the definition also fix the input-head position comparison at `t` beyond
   both halts?
6. `oblivious_of_mem_DTIME`: is the repaired (`c · (T n + 1)`-budget)
   `TimeConstructible` sufficient for the padding argument, and is the conclusion
   shape (`DecidesInTime` within `c · (T n + 1)²`) consistent with the sweep
   simulation that continues past the simulated machine's halt?
7. `computesFunInTime_comp`: is `Monotone T₂` the right hypothesis (vs monotone-on-a
   -tail, or replacing `T₂ (T₁ n)` by `sup`)? Is the bound shape
   `c · (T₁ n + T₂ (T₁ n) + 1)` achievable given the rewind of the intermediate tape
   and phase switching? Check the `|f x| ≤ T₁ |x|` step against `output_length_le`
   (length ≤ *halting time* ≤ budget).
8. The two convention dispositions in item 5 above: acceptable, or should either be a
   formal theorem in phase 2?
9. Adversarial instantiations to attempt: `T = fun _ => 0` through each robustness
   statement (bounds are padded — do any degenerate?); a `k = 0` machine through
   `one_work_tape` and `nonnegative_heads`; `f = id` and `g` constant through `comp`;
   an `Oblivious` machine that never halts (do the definitions admit it, and should
   they?); `Γ` a one-element type in `alphabet_reduction` (then `e : Bool ↪ Γ` cannot
   exist — is the theorem vacuous there, and is that fine?).

# Formalization Plan: Arora-Barak Chapter 1

**Branch:** `complexity/arora-barak-ch1` · **Governing standards:** [`policy.md`](policy.md)

This document is the working plan for formalizing Chapter 1 of Arora & Barak,
*Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach* (CUP 2009) — "The computational model — and
why it doesn't matter" (book pages 9–37) — in TCSlib. It records the foundation decision,
the architecture that keeps the model robust to variations (oracles, nondeterminism), the
module layout, and the phasing. Source tag throughout the development: `[AB09]`.

## 1. Scope: what Chapter 1 contains

| Section | Content | In scope |
|---|---|---|
| §1.2 | k-tape TM `(Γ, Q, δ)`: read-only input tape, work tapes, output tape (read-write in [AB09]; append-only write-only in our model — a variation [AB09, p. 19] itself sanctions, declared in `DTIME.lean`); start configuration; halting; Example 1.1 (palindromes in 3n steps) | Yes |
| §1.3 | Computing `f` in time `T(n)` (Def 1.3); time-constructibility; Claim 1.5 (alphabet reduction, `4 log|Γ|` slowdown); Claim 1.6 (k tapes → 1 tape, `5kT²`); Remark 1.7 (oblivious TMs); Claim 1.8 (bidirectional → unidirectional, `4T`) | Yes (oblivious: statement only at first) |
| §1.4 | Machines as strings: every string decodes to some TM, every TM has infinitely many encodings; universal TM; Theorem 1.9 (universal simulation), relaxed `O(T²)` version; time-bounded universal TM | Yes |
| §1.5 | Uncomputability: `UC` via diagonalization (Thm 1.10); `HALT` via reduction (Thm 1.11); §1.5.2 Gödel discussion | Thms 1.10–1.11 yes; Gödel material is prose — out of scope |
| §1.6 | `DTIME(T(n))` (Def 1.12, with constant absorption), `P` (Def 1.13), examples | Yes |
| §1.7 | Hennie-Stearns `O(T log T)` universal simulation (amortized zone argument) | Stretch goal, off the critical path |

Additionally in scope, ahead of the book's own ordering: the **oracle TM** definition
(the book defers it to §3.4). We pull it forward to validate that the architecture supports
model variations before the expensive theorems are built on it.

## 2. Foundation decision

**Decision: vendor cslib's multi-tape TM model; do not build on Mathlib's TMs; do not take
cslib as a dependency.** Findings behind this (surveyed Sept 2026, against our pinned
mathlib `029db123ddaa`, toolchain v4.25.0):

- **Mathlib** is a computability library, not a complexity library. It has no multi-tape TM
  (TM0/TM1 are single-tape, TM2 is a stack machine); its model-simulation theorems carry no
  time bounds; `TM2ComputableInPolyTime` is a stub whose only instance is `id`. Building
  Arora-Barak on it means fighting the design. What we do reuse: `Language`,
  `Turing.FinEncoding`, and (later, as an optional bridge) the recursion-theory stack
  (`Nat.Partrec`, `Halting`/Rice, `Reduce`, `RecursiveIn`).
- **cslib** (github.com/leanprover/cslib, `Cslib/Computability/Machines/Turing/MultiTape/`,
  Apache-2.0) has an Arora-Barak-style `MultiTapeTM` (its write-only output tape is an
  [AB09, p. 19]-sanctioned variation of the book's read-write one): read-only input
  tape, k work tapes, explicit time and space semantics, a nondeterministic
  variant, and configuration-count bounds — actively developed, with a complexity roadmap
  (issue #611) that plans oracles as a wrapper over any model.
- **Why vendor rather than depend:** cslib targets Lean v4.35.0-rc1 with the new module
  system; TCSlib is pinned to v4.25.0 and the PFR dependency chains us there. The vendored
  surface is small (~1,400 lines). We stay structurally aligned with upstream so we can
  migrate to a real dependency at the next toolchain bump, and upstream anything we prove
  that they lack (universal TM, robustness claims).
- Vendored files follow `policy.md` §2: original copyright headers preserved, source commit
  recorded, local modifications listed (expected: de-module-system syntax, import-path
  ports to v4.25 mathlib).

Reference mechanization to mine for proof architecture: the Isabelle AFP entry
`Cook_Levin` (Balbach) — the only completed Arora-Barak-faithful development. Its lemma
decomposition, especially for TM composition and the universal machine, transfers.

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 The Action/apply split (model variations)

cslib's configuration layer mentions no machine: a step is an **`Action`** (input-head
move, per-work-tape write/move, optional output symbol, successor state) plus
**`Action.apply`** (its effect on a configuration). A *machine* is then just the thing
that **chooses** the action from the current state and read symbols. Every model twist is a
different chooser over the same configurations, the same `apply`, and the same run/time/
space measures:

| Model | Chooser |
|---|---|
| Deterministic TM (Ch. 1) | function `State × reads → Action` |
| Nondeterministic TM (Ch. 2) | relation over actions |
| Oracle TM (§3.4, Definition 3.4, pulled forward) | function consulting `O : Language _` via query tape and `q_query`/`q_yes`/`q_no` states (pairwise distinct: `OracleTM.WellFormed`) |
| Probabilistic TM (Ch. 7, future) | two transition functions + coin |

Because `DTIME`-style definitions are stated over the shared run layer, `P`, `Pᴼ`, and
later `NP`/`BPP` are instances of one pattern, not parallel developments. Phase 1 locks
the design with sanity theorems in both directions: a plain machine embeds as an oracle
machine whose runs are in lockstep with the original under *every* oracle
(`ofMultiTapeTM`), and conversely an oracle machine run with the empty oracle is
eliminated into a plain machine in exact lockstep (`plainEmptyOracle`).

### 3.2 Finiteness: raw layer vs. bundled layer

Finiteness of `Γ` and `Q` is mathematically non-negotiable: with infinite states, δ can
memorize the input and decide any language in linear time (P would collapse to all
languages), and `⌞M⌟` has no finite representation. The design question is only *where*
the hypothesis lives:

- **Raw layer** (`MultiTapeTM k Γ Q`, parametric types, no finiteness): configurations,
  `step`, runs, time/space counting, and simulation *constructions*. Deferring finiteness
  here keeps semantics lemmas clean and lets compound state types (`Q × Γᵏ`, `Option Q`,
  sums) arise without instance-threading; finiteness of a constructed machine is an
  afterthought (`inferInstance`). This follows both cslib and mathlib TM0/TM1 practice.
- **Bundled layer** (`FinTM Symbol`: a raw machine bundled with `Fintype`/`DecidableEq`
  instances for its *state* type — analogous to mathlib's `FinTM2`): **all headline
  definitions and theorems** — `DTIME`, `P`, `⌞M⌟`, Theorem 1.9, oracle classes — are
  stated exclusively over the bundled layer, so a finiteness hypothesis can never be
  forgotten. The alphabet is *not* bundled: it stays an explicit parameter, fixed to
  `Bool` by the headline classes; results over a general `Symbol` (e.g. machine
  encodings) take `[Fintype Symbol]`/`[DecidableEq Symbol]` at their statements, and
  oracle complexity classes (Ch. 3) will introduce a finite oracle-machine bundle
  before they are defined. Encoding needs `Fintype`/`DecidableEq` as *data* (δ's table
  must be enumerated), which is why the bundle carries instances rather than `Finite`
  propositions.

Per `policy.md` §1 (layering), the raw layer is internal plumbing; the bundled layer is
the textbook object.

### 3.3 Conventions

- **Strings/languages:** `{0,1}*` as in the book; languages via mathlib's `Language`.
- **Namespaces:** `Turing` for the vendored core (minimizes diff against upstream; no
  clashes with mathlib's `Turing.*` at our pin), `Complexity` for classes and
  uncomputability. Revisit only if a clash appears.
- **NP/NTM:** strictly Chapter 1 here. cslib's nondeterministic file is in the vendorable
  set but lands with the Chapter 2 effort.

## 4. Module layout

Per `policy.md` §1: facades, 150–600-line files, precise imports, `TCSlib.lean` exports.

```

## 5. Phasing

Each phase lands first as a **compiling sorry-skeleton** (the GraphTheory/Core precedent):
statements are the contract, proofs fill in via the sorry-ladder workflow. Per `policy.md`
§3, proof sketches are written at skeleton time — each `sorry` corresponds to a named
sketch step. After each phase compiles: dep-graph rebuild, `/blueprint-extract`,
`blueprint_validate.py --strict`, `dataset_hygiene.py --strict`. The blueprint is
**late-bound**: extraction runs only at phase boundaries, and no blueprint LaTeX is
written by hand ahead of the Lean.

### Audit protocol (between phases)

Right after a phase's skeleton lands — statements frozen, proofs mostly `sorry` — an
**external audit** runs before the next phase begins: an LLM from a different vendor, in
a fresh context, reviews the phase's trusted surface (definitions, theorem statements,
remaining sorries) against the book, adversarially. Statement bugs are the dominant
failure mode of formalization (Lean already checks proofs) and are cheapest to fix at
this moment. Mechanics: instantiate `audits/TEMPLATE.md` as `audits/phaseN-pack.md`, hand
it plus the listed files to the auditor, record results in `audits/phaseN-findings.md`;
every finding is fixed or explicitly waived before the next phase starts. An optional
light second pass when a phase's proofs complete diffs the statements for quiet
weakening. Audits complement, not replace, in-Lean sanity theorems, which are the
machine-checked and permanent form of the same checks.

1. **Core model + classes.** Port the two vendored files to v4.25; `Finite.lean`;
   `ComputesInTime`, `decides`, `DTIME`, `P`; the oracle wrapper + trivial-oracle sanity
   theorem; PAL as an end-to-end usability check. *This phase alone unblocks future
   chapters (NP needs only these definitions).*
2. **Robustness.** Claims 1.5, 1.6, 1.8; `Composition.lean` combinators; corollary that P
   is invariant under the model tweaks. First real machine-construction proofs — builds
   the simulation vocabulary everything later reuses. Scope now explicitly includes the
   simulation obligations recorded by the phase-1 audit: append-only vs read-write
   output tape (constant overhead), start-marker/initialization conventions, and
   persistent vs auto-erased oracle query tape (polynomial overhead only — a
   constant-overhead simulation is provably impossible; findings 3-4).
3. **Encodings + universal machine.** `⌞M⌟` with totality and padding lemmas; Theorem 1.9
   in the relaxed `O(T²)` form (U simulates the one-work-tape, four-symbol normal form
   from phase 2) and the time-bounded variant.
4. **Uncomputability.** Thm 1.10 (needs only encoding + semantics; the diagonalization is
   short); Thm 1.11 (needs composition + the universal machine).
5. **Stretch — explicitly off the critical path.** §1.7's `O(T log T)` simulation;
   oblivious TMs; the RAM-TM exercise (Ex 1.9); the mathlib recursion-theory bridge.

**Blueprint reference ingestion:** ingest Chapter 1 as
`blueprint/src/references/arora-barak-ch01-*.md` (raw/clean pair, ch. 13 shows the format)
so `\statementsource`/`\proofsource` citations are possible once proofmatch runs are
approved.

## 6. Risks and honest effort assessment

- **The proof-sketch gap is the main cost.** The book proves Claims 1.5/1.6 and Thm 1.9 in
  a paragraph each; formally these are the expensive items. The AFP `Cook_Levin` entry
  spent most of its effort exactly here. `Composition.lean` is the hidden load-bearing
  file — budget for it.
- **Vendoring means drift** against a fast-moving upstream. Mitigation: minimal local
  modification, source commit recorded per file, periodic upstream diffs.
- **Definitions before theorems pays off:** phases 1–2 already give TCSlib a citable,
  blueprint-documented model of computation with P and oracles, onto which the existing
  `Complexity/NPReductions/` files can eventually be retargeted — even if phases 3–5 fill
  slowly.

## 7. Decision log

| Decision | Status |
|---|---|
| Vendor cslib `MultiTapeTM`; reuse mathlib only for `Language`/`FinEncoding`/bridge | Decided |
| Finiteness deferred in raw layer, enforced via bundled `FinTM` for all headline defs | Decided |
| Oracle wrapper lands in phase 1 (ahead of book order) | Decided |
| Work on branch `complexity/arora-barak-ch1`; verify via `scripts/lean_check.sh` (CI runs on main only) | Decided |
| Namespaces: `Turing` (vendored core) / `Complexity` (classes) | Working assumption; revisit on clash |
| NP/NTM signatures deferred to Chapter 2 work | Decided |
| §1.7 `O(T log T)` and oblivious-TM proofs are stretch goals | Decided |
| Blueprint: late-bound — generated from compiled Lean at phase boundaries only, nothing hand-written ahead of the Lean | Decided |
| External audits between phases: cross-vendor LLM with prepared packs (`audits/`), findings gate the next phase | Decided |
| Vendored cslib source commit: `a374775894efb9b7196cccf11235c60a97086dc1` (2026-09-14); relational semantics (`RelatesInSteps`) dropped in the port | Decided |
| Phase-1 audit round 1 (`audits/phase1-findings.md`): all 8 sorries confirmed true; 3 majors fixed — `TimeConstructible` repaired to `∃ c > 0, … c·(T n + 1)` (the literal exact bound refutes AB's own `id` example in this model), `OracleTM.WellFormed` added, oracle-tape constant-overhead claim corrected to polynomial; minors swept; audit-requested sanity statements added. Oracle citation is [AB09, Definition 3.4] (not 3.6) | Decided |
| Phase 1 requires a clean re-audit of the fixes before phase 2 starts | Decided |
| Phase-1 audit round 2 (`audits/phase1-reaudit-findings.md`): zero blockers/majors — all round-1 resolutions verified, all 8 new sorries confirmed true (with a worked `timeConstructible_id` witness machine reusable in the fill phase); 5 prose minors swept, blankness-certificate lemma added per note 6. **Phase-1 audit gate closed**; see `audits/phase1-resolutions.md` | Decided |
| Phase-2 renderings: Claim 1.6 rendered as **one work tape** (the merged input/work/output single-tape model is a different structure, out of scope); Claim 1.8 rendered as **`NonnegativeHeads`** (our tapes are already bidirectional, so the meaningful direction is unidirectional use); obliviousness compares head positions at all times, which forces length-determined halting and hence the `TimeConstructible` hypothesis in Exercise 1.5 | Decided — for phase-2 audit |
| Output-tape/initialization convention obligations (phase-1 finding 4) discharged by `Composition.lean`'s buffer-and-flush construction plus documentation, on the grounds that no exact step count is ever imported from [AB09] (every bound carries an existential constant) | Decided — for phase-2 audit to assess |
| Persistent-vs-erased query-tape polynomial-overhead statement moved from phase 2 to the Chapter 3 oracle-class work, where polynomial overhead is meaningful (class level); the impossibility of constant overhead stays documented in `Oracle.lean` | Decided — for phase-2 audit to assess |
| Fate of this file at merge (graduate to `docs/` vs. superseded by blueprint) | Open — decide at merge time |

# TCSlib Contribution Policy

Standards for all Lean contributions to this repository, whether written by humans or by
agents. This document covers three things: **modularity** (how code is organized),
**attribution** (how every result is traced to a source), and **proof sketches** (how every
formal proof is accompanied by readable mathematics).

It complements, and does not replace:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — build workflows, import rules, CI integration points.
- `AGENTS.md` / `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — the sorry-ladder proof workflow and agent roster.
- `blueprint/BLUEPRINT_PIPELINE.md` — how blueprint entries are generated and validated.

Where this document names an existing mechanism (blueprint macros, hygiene scripts), the
policy is to *use that mechanism*, not to invent a parallel one.

## 1. Modularity

**Layout.** Content lives at `TCSlib/<Area>/<Topic>/<Piece>.lean`, one coherent concept or
lemma cluster per file, with a facade file `TCSlib/<Area>/<Topic>.lean` that imports every
child and carries a `/-! -/` module docstring with a `## Contents` list (one line per child).
See `TCSlib/Complexity/NPReductions.lean` for the reference example.

**File size.** Target 150–600 lines per math file. A file approaching 1000 lines should be
split unless there is a positive reason not to (e.g. a single long proof that cannot be
usefully decomposed).

**Exports.** Every new topic facade must be imported from `TCSlib.lean`. CI only builds what
is reachable from `TCSlib.lean`; an unexported file is invisible to CI, docs, and the
blueprint.

**Imports.** Precise module imports only. A bare `import Mathlib` fails CI. Import only what
the file uses.

**Namespaces.** Namespaces are area-local: pick one namespace root per topic and use it
consistently within that topic. Do not leak auxiliary definitions into the root namespace;
mark internal helpers `private` or put them in a dedicated inner namespace.

**Layering.** Keep definition files separate from heavyweight theorem files, so that
downstream work can import a model or a class definition without pulling in every proof about
it. When a development has both a "raw/general" layer and a "bundled" layer (e.g. a machine
model that is parametric in its types, plus a bundled version carrying finiteness instances),
headline definitions and theorems are stated against the bundled layer; the raw layer is
internal plumbing.

**Helpers.** Foundational helper lemmas that serve a whole area belong in that area's
`Basic.lean`, not in the file that first needed them.

**File header.** Every math file begins with the Mathlib-style copyright block, its imports,
the repo-standard options

```
set_option maxHeartbeats 0
set_option relaxedAutoImplicit false
set_option autoImplicit false
```

then a module docstring containing `# Title`, `## Main definitions`, `## Main results`, and
`## References` (see §2).

## 2. Attribution

Every mathematical statement in the library must be traceable to a source, at the level of
precision of a textbook theorem number or a paper section.

**File-level.** Every math file's module docstring contains a `## References` section giving
full citations with short tags, e.g.

```
## References

* [AB09] S. Arora, B. Barak, *Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach*,
  Cambridge University Press, 2009.
```

**Declaration-level.** Every definition, theorem, and lemma that corresponds to a result in
a source carries the tag with a precise location in its docstring: `[AB09, Claim 1.6]`,
`[AB09, §1.7]`, `[GRS25, Thm 4.2.1]`. Purely technical glue lemmas with no textbook
counterpart may omit the tag; anything a reader would recognize as "a result" may not.

**Deviations.** If the formal statement deviates from the source — different constants,
strengthened or weakened hypotheses, a reformulation — the docstring must say so and briefly
say why (e.g. "stated with explicit constant 5k rather than O(·), following the proof").

**Blueprint.** When an ingested reference exists under `blueprint/src/references/`, blueprint
entries use `\statementsource{<ref>}{<anchor>}` and `\proofsource{<ref>}{<anchor>}` to cite
it, subject to the existing rule that these are written only after an approved proofmatch
run. When starting a new chapter or paper, ingest it as a reference pair
(`<name>.raw.md` + `<name>.md`) so these citations are possible.

**Vendored code.** Lean code adapted from another project keeps the original copyright
header and license notice, and its file docstring names the source project, the commit it
was taken from, and a summary of local modifications.

## 3. Proof sketches

Every nontrivial formal proof is accompanied by a human-readable English proof sketch, kept
next to the Lean it describes.

**What counts as nontrivial.** Rule of thumb: any proof longer than ~20 lines of tactics, or
that would rate difficulty ≥ 3 on the blueprint scale. One-line `simp`/`omega`/`exact`
proofs need no sketch.

**Where sketches live.** In the Lean file itself:

- For most theorems: a `**Proof sketch.**` paragraph at the end of the theorem's docstring,
  written in mathematical English (not Lean identifiers), naming the key intermediate steps.
- For long proofs: additionally, short comments at the major `have`/section boundaries tying
  the tactics back to the sketch's steps.

The named intermediate steps of a sketch should be visible in the formalization as `have`s
or standalone lemmas — if the sketch says "first reduce to the one-tape case", there should
be a lemma that is that reduction.

**Where sketches do not live.** Not in the blueprint. Blueprint statement entries state
claims only; `scripts/dataset_hygiene.py --strict` hard-fails on proof content there. The
blueprint records *what* is true and its dependency structure; the Lean docstrings record
*why* it is true.

**Sketches and the sorry ladder.** When landing a sorry-skeleton, write the sketch at
skeleton time — the sketch *is* the plan, and each `sorry` should correspond to a named step
of it. A skeleton whose sketch cannot be written is not ready to land.

**Synchronization.** When a proof strategy changes, the sketch changes in the same commit.
A sketch that describes a proof the code no longer performs is worse than no sketch.

## Review checklist

Before merging new Lean content, check:

1. Files follow the Area/Topic layout with a facade, and `TCSlib.lean` exports are updated.
2. Imports are precise; no bare `import Mathlib`.
3. Every file has a `## References` section; every source-derived declaration has a
   `[Tag, location]` in its docstring; deviations from sources are noted.
4. Every nontrivial proof (or sorry-stub standing in for one) has a proof sketch.
5. `zsh scripts/lean_check.sh <file>` reports zero errors for each touched file.
6. If blueprint content was touched: `python3 scripts/blueprint_validate.py --strict` and
   `python3 scripts/dataset_hygiene.py --strict` pass.

# Composition of Turing machine computations

Basic computability combinators for the bundled machines: the identity and constant
functions are linear-time computable, and time-bounded computability is closed under
composition. Composition is the load-bearing lemma of the whole development — the
universal machine (phase 3) and the `HALT` reduction (phase 4) are built from it — and
it is the part [AB09] never spells out, dispatching it with "high-level descriptions"
of machines. The Isabelle AFP `Cook_Levin` entry spends a large fraction of its effort
exactly here.

## Design

Composition is stated at the *specification* level (`ComputesFunInTime`), not as an
operator on raw machines: the composed machine is existentially produced. Internally
(proof obligation, not API) the construction simulates `M₁` with its emissions
redirected to a fresh work tape, then simulates `M₂` reading that tape in place of its
input tape.

**Convention obligation discharged here** (phase-1 audit, finding 4): the redirect-then-
flush construction inside `computesFunInTime_comp` is precisely the simulation of
[AB09]'s read-write output tape by our append-only one — a machine that wants to revise
its output buffers it on a work tape and emits only at the end. Since every
time bound in this development carries an existential constant, the constant-factor
overhead of buffering is absorbed, and no exact step count is ever transported between
the two output conventions.

## Main results

* `Complexity.TuringMachine`-level combinators (all over the binary alphabet):
  `Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_id`, `Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_const`,
  `Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_comp`.

the time that produced it: `|f x| ≤ T₁ |x|` by `Turing.MultiTapeTM.output_length_le`.
Monotonicity of `T₂` is genuinely needed to convert that length bound into a time

simulates `M₁` step for step on the true input, with `M₁`'s emissions written instead
onto the dedicated intermediate tape (constant overhead per step; this is the
append-only-output buffering discussed in the module docstring). Phase two rewinds the
intermediate tape head (at most `T₁ n` steps) and simulates `M₂` step for step, with
`M₂`'s input-head reads served from the intermediate tape and `M₂`'s emissions going to
the real output tape. Phase two costs constant overhead per step of `M₂`, which halts
within `T₂ |f x| ≤ T₂ (T₁ n)` steps. Bookkeeping (phase switching, boundary detection
on the intermediate tape) is absorbed into `c`. -/

# Alphabet reduction

[AB09, Claim 1.5]: a machine over any finite alphabet `Γ` is simulated by a machine
over the binary alphabet with only a constant-factor slowdown (the constant depending
on `|Γ|`), and with the same number of work tapes. This is the theorem that justifies
defining `DTIME` over binary-alphabet machines (see
`TCSlib.Complexity.ClassP.DTIME`).

## Deviations from [AB09]

* [AB09] states the slowdown as `4 log |Γ| · T(n)`; we existentialize the constant and
  pad with `+ 1` (empty input), consistently with the rest of the development.
* [AB09]'s statement fixes input and output over `{0,1}` with only the *work* alphabet
  reduced. In our model a machine has one alphabet for all tapes, so "computing a
  binary function" for a `Γ`-machine is expressed via a symbol embedding `e : Bool ↪ Γ`
  (`Turing.FinTM.ComputesFunInTimeVia`): the simulator reads genuine binary input
  directly (its table composes with `e`), block-encodes work-tape symbols in
  `⌈log₂ |Γ|⌉` bits, and decodes each emitted symbol `e b` back to the bit `b`.
  Emitted symbols are always in the range of `e` because the append-only output equals
  the final output string, which is `(f x).map e`.

## Main results

* `Turing.FinTM.alphabet_reduction` — [AB09, Claim 1.5].

/-- **Alphabet reduction** [AB09, Claim 1.5]: if a machine over a finite alphabet `Γ`
computes the binary string function `f` via `e : Bool ↪ Γ` within time `T`, then a
binary-alphabet machine with the *same number of work tapes* computes `f` within
`c · (T n + 1)` for some constant `c` (depending on the original machine).

**Proof sketch.** Fix a binary block code of length `L = ⌈log₂ |Γ|⌉` for `Option Γ`'s
non-blank symbols. `M'` keeps each of `M`'s work tapes as a block-encoded tape. One
step of `M` is simulated by: reading the `L` bits under each work head into the state
(`L` steps per tape, walking right), reading the input bit directly (its `e`-image is
determined by the table), computing `M`'s transition inside the finite state, writing
back the `L`-bit codes while returning left (`L` steps per tape), moving each head `L`
cells in the simulated direction, and emitting the decoded bit whenever `M` emits.
Total: at most `c` steps of `M'` per step of `M` with `c = O(k · L)`, plus a constant
start-up; blanks are handled by reserving one block code for "blank". The invariant
relating block-encoded configurations to `M`'s configurations is preserved by each
simulated step, and `M`'s halting transfers. -/

# Reduction to one work tape

[AB09, Claim 1.6]: `k` work tapes are simulated by a single work tape with a quadratic
slowdown.

## Deviations from [AB09]

* [AB09]'s Claim 1.6 merges input, work, *and output* into one single tape (the
  standard model of Sipser's text). Our model structurally always has a separate
  read-only input tape and write-only output tape, so the faithful in-model rendering
  is **one work tape**: the interesting content — interleaving `k` tapes on one, with
  marked head positions and full sweeps — is identical, while the merged-single-tape
  model itself is out of scope (it is a different structure, not an instance of
  `MultiTapeTM`).
* [AB09] states the slowdown as `5k T(n)²`; we existentialize the constant and use
  `(T n + 1)²`.

## Main results

* `Turing.FinTM.one_work_tape` — [AB09, Claim 1.6] over an enlarged alphabet.
* `Turing.FinTM.one_work_tape_binary` — combined with alphabet reduction
  ([AB09, Claim 1.5]): one work tape *and* binary alphabet, still quadratic.

**Proof sketch.** The single work tape of `M'` stores the `k` tapes of `M`
interleaved: cell `j·k + i` of the simulated layout holds cell `j` of tape `i`
(centered at `0` in both directions). The alphabet is enlarged to mark, for each
simulated tape, the currently scanned cell (`Γ' = pairs of a symbol and a "head here"
flag`, embedded via `e`). To simulate one step of `M`, `M'` sweeps its work tape once
left-to-right across the visited zone recording the `k` marked symbols in its state,
computes `M`'s transition, and sweeps back right-to-left updating the marked cells and
moving the marks. After `t` steps of `M` the visited zone spans `O(k · (t + 1))`
cells, so each simulated step costs `O(k · (T n + 1))` and the total is
`c · (T n + 1)²`. Input reads and output emissions pass through unchanged. -/

# Bidirectional versus unidirectional tapes

[AB09, Claim 1.8]: tapes that are infinite in both directions are simulated by tapes
infinite in one direction only, with constant-factor slowdown.

## Deviations from [AB09]

Our vendored model's tapes are *already* bidirectional (`ℤ`-indexed) — that choice is
what lets initialization dispense with start markers. So the faithful in-model
rendering of Claim 1.8 runs in the only meaningful direction: every machine is
simulated, with constant-factor slowdown and the same number of work tapes, by one
whose work heads **never visit a negative cell** (`Turing.FinTM.NonnegativeHeads`),
i.e. by a machine that uses its tapes unidirectionally. The simulating machine "folds"
each tape at the origin over the doubled alphabet `Γ × Γ`, exactly as in [AB09]'s
proof.

## Main results

* `Turing.FinTM.NonnegativeHeads` — the unidirectional-use predicate.
* `Turing.FinTM.nonnegative_heads` — [AB09, Claim 1.8].

(a boundary check may cost one extra), giving `c · (T n + 1)` — [AB09] gets `4T`.
Head positions of the simulator are absolute values of simulated positions, hence
nonnegative, and the folding invariant transfers computation and halting. -/

# Oblivious machines

A machine is *oblivious* if its head movements depend only on the input length, not on
the input itself [AB09, Remark 1.7 and Exercise 1.5]. Obliviousness will matter for
the Cook-Levin theorem (Chapter 2), where the tableau of an oblivious computation has
input-independent structure.

## Design

* Configurations are indexed by their input, so head positions of runs on different
  inputs live in different types only for the input head; obliviousness compares
  `Fin`-valued input positions through `ℕ` and work positions (in `ℤ`) directly.
* Because halting is absorbing, a machine's head positions freeze when it halts.
  Consequently an oblivious machine necessarily halts after a number of steps that
  depends only on the input length (else two same-length inputs would freeze heads at
  different positions at large `t` — unless the frozen positions happen to agree).
  This is why the simulation below carries a `TimeConstructible` hypothesis, matching
  [AB09, Exercise 1.5]: the simulator must pad its own running time to an
  input-length-determined step count.
* We state the quadratic version (Exercise 1.5); the `O(T log T)` sharpening
  (Exercise 1.6) is a stretch goal alongside §1.7, off the critical path.

## Main definitions

* `Turing.FinTM.Oblivious` — [AB09, Remark 1.7].

## Main results

* `Complexity.oblivious_of_mem_DTIME` — [AB09, Exercise 1.5]: every language decidable
  in time-constructible time `T` is decided by an oblivious machine in `O((T + 1)²)`.

rather than reacting to symbols. It then performs `Θ(T n)` full sweeps over a zone of
size `Θ(T n)`, one sweep per simulated step of the one-work-tape form of `M`
(`Turing.FinTM.one_work_tape_binary`), always sweeping the whole zone regardless of
where the simulated head sits, and continues sweeping idly (ignoring the halted
simulated configuration) until a step counter derived from `⌞T n⌟` expires, emitting
the answer in a final length-determined flourish. Every head trajectory is a function

# "And why it doesn't matter": model invariance of DTIME and P

The payoff of the robustness theorems ([AB09, §1.3.1], formalized in
`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Robustness`): the classes `DTIME` (up to constants)
and `P` (exactly) do not depend on the low-level model choices — alphabet size and
number of work tapes. This is the formal content of the chapter's title.

  language via a symbol embedding.

## Main results

* `Complexity.mem_DTIME_of_decidesInTimeVia` — deciding over any finite alphabet lands
  in binary `DTIME` (constant absorbed). [AB09, Claim 1.5 for languages]
* `Complexity.mem_P_of_decidesInTimeVia_poly` — `P` is alphabet-invariant.

# Bundled finite Turing machines

The raw model `Turing.MultiTapeTM k Symbol State` deliberately does not require `Symbol` or
`State` to be finite: semantics, simulations, and resource counting do not need it, and
compound state types arise freely in constructions. Finiteness is nevertheless
mathematically essential for complexity theory — with infinitely many states a machine can
memorize its whole input in the state and decide any language in linear time, and an
infinite transition table has no string encoding.

This file provides the bundled layer `Turing.FinTM`: a machine together with `Fintype` and
`DecidableEq` instances for its state type. All headline definitions of the Chapter 1
development (`DTIME`, `P`, machine encodings, the universal machine) are stated exclusively
over `FinTM`, so the finiteness hypothesis can never be dropped by accident. The instances
are carried as *data* (not `Finite` propositions) because the machine-encoding function
`⌞M⌟` must enumerate the transition table.

The alphabet parameter `Symbol` stays explicit and unbundled: the Chapter 1 headline
definitions fix `Symbol := Bool` (see `TCSlib.Complexity.ClassP.DTIME`), and results that
need a finite alphabet for a general `Symbol` take `[Fintype Symbol]` hypotheses at use
sites.

## Main definitions

* `Turing.FinTM Symbol` — a multi-tape TM over alphabet `Option Symbol` with a bundled
  finite state type. [AB09, §1.2]
* `Turing.FinTM.ComputesInTime` — the machine halts on `input` within `t` steps with
  `output` on the output tape (time-only variant of
  `Turing.MultiTapeTM.ComputesInTimeAndSpace`). [AB09, Definition 1.3]
* `Turing.FinTM.ComputesFunInTime` — the machine computes `f` in time `T`.
  [AB09, Definition 1.3]

## Main results

* `Turing.FinTM.ComputesInTime.mono` — halting is absorbing, so the time bound can be
  weakened.
* `Turing.FinTM.not_computesInTime_zero` — no machine computes anything in zero steps
  (the initial state is not the halting state).
* `Turing.MultiTapeTM.output_length_le`, `Turing.MultiTapeTM.output_prefix` — raw-layer
  output lemmas (at most one symbol is emitted per step, and output only grows), stated
  here rather than in the vendored `Deterministic.lean` to keep the vendored files
  unmodified.

*via* the symbol embedding `e : α ↪ Γ`: on every input `x.map e` it halts within

**Proof sketch.** By `Turing.MultiTapeTM.runFrom_add` the run to step `t'` factors through
step `t`; the state there is `none`, so `Turing.MultiTapeTM.runFrom_of_halt` shows the
configuration no longer changes, and in particular state and output at step `t'` agree with
step `t`. The space used up to step `t'` exists (it is whatever `spaceUsed` evaluates to),
which discharges the existential. -/

# Configurations of Multi-Tape Turing Machines

Configurations of a multi-tape Turing machine with a read-only input tape, `k` work tapes and one
write-only output tape, together with what a single transition does to one and the space measure
read off a list of them.

## Design

Nothing here mentions a machine. A step is described in two parts: an `Action`, recording
which way the input head moves, what is written and where the work heads move, which symbol is
emitted and which state follows; and `Action.apply`, which carries it out on a
configuration.

The output tape is part of the configuration, so the string emitted along a run can be read off
the configuration the run ends in.

## Main definitions

* `Cfg`: the configuration: the internal state, the tape contents and head positions, and the
    output tape
* `Action`: what a machine does in one step
* `Action.apply`: the effect of one action on a configuration
* `Cfg.Halted`, `Cfg.init`: halting, and the configuration a machine starts in
* `spaceUsedOfCfgs`: work tape cells touched along a list of configurations

# Deterministic Multi-Tape Turing Machines

Defines deterministic Turing machines with a read-only input tape, `k` work tapes and one
write-only output tape.
The tapes contain symbols from `Option Symbol` for a finite alphabet `Symbol` (where `none` is the
blank symbol).

## Design

The multi-tape Turing machine uses a read-only input tape, `k` work tapes and a write-only output
tape.
The input head can move freely on the input, but any move attempt beyond one cell outside the input
results in no movement.
The transition function can optionally output one symbol, which models the write-only output tape.
Because of these restrictions, we ignore the input and output tapes for space usage of the machine.
The space usage is defined as the total number of cells the work tape heads visited during
execution.

Restricting the movement of the input head is not essential, but useful because it allows
us to easily bound the number of possible configurations of a space-bounded machine. Most textbooks
have this restriction.

Instead of considering the cells _visited_ by the work tape heads, some textbooks
(including [AB09]) only consider the number of cells that contain
a non-blank symbol at some point in the execution or the number of cells written to. This allows
work tape heads to freely move at no cost as long as they do not write. It is
important to note that this causes `DSPACE(1)` to include `DSPACE(log log n)`, a class that
contains e.g. the non-regular language `{0^n 1^n | n ∈ ℕ}` (it is accepted by a TM that writes a
single marker on the work tape and then counts the number of symbols by work tape head movement
without writing).
Defining space usage via "cells visited" thus yields the more fine-grained "complexity world" in
which `DSPACE(1)` is exactly the class of regular languages.

This definition is adapted from the one in [Pap94], chapter 2.3 including
the sub-linear space modifications from chapter 2.5 with the following changes:
- We allow Turing machines to choose to not write on a tape. This is equivalent to
  writing the read symbol again but makes it easier to reason about the semantics.
- Our tapes are infinite in both directions instead of just to the right. This definition is
  equivalent (see [AB09], Claim 1.8). It saves us from having to add a "start marker" to
  the alphabet.
- We only have a single halting state. The different ways to halt (accepting, rejecting, etc) can
  be distinguished based on the output.
- The way to prevent the input head to move outside the input is enforced by the interpretation
  and not by a restriction on the transition function. The two definitions are equivalent, but
  not restricting the transition function makes it easier to define a universal machine.

## Main definitions

We define a number of structures and concepts related to multi-tape Turing machine computation:

* `MultiTapeTM`: the TM itself
* `MultiTapeTM.runFrom`: the configuration reached after a given number of execution steps
* `spaceUsed`: the number of work tape cells touched by the heads until a certain step,
    our main space measure
* `ComputesInTimeAndSpace`: a proof that a specific TM computes an output from an input in a certain
    number of steps and using a certain number of tape cells
* `ComputesFunInTimeAndSpace`: a machine computes a function between specified encodings,
    respecting time and space bounds on each actual input.
* `ComputableInTimeAndSpace`: such a machine exists with binary alphabet and finitely many states.
* `ComputableInTimeAndSpaceOfLength`: the specialization to bounds on encoded input length.
* `DecidableInTimeAndSpace`: a proof that a TM decides a language within a certain time
    and space bound.

# Oracle Turing machines

An oracle Turing machine [AB09, §3.4, Definition 3.4; pulled forward to Chapter 1 to
validate the model architecture] is a multi-tape machine with one additional designated
*query tape* and three designated states `qQuery`, `qYes`, `qNo`. Whenever the machine
enters `qQuery`, the string currently written on the query tape is submitted to the oracle
`O`: in a single step the machine moves to `qYes` if the query is in `O` and to `qNo`
otherwise, with all tapes and heads unchanged.

## Design

This file is the architectural test of the `Action`/`Action.apply` split: an oracle machine
reuses the configurations `Turing.Cfg (k + 1)` (the query tape is the extra work tape, at
index `Fin.last k`) and the action application of the plain model, and differs *only* in how
the next action is chosen — the step function is parametrized by the oracle
`O : Language Symbol`. Time and space measures therefore transfer unchanged.

Definitional choices worth auditing:

* **The query string** (`OracleTM.queryString`) is read from cell `0` of the query tape
  rightward up to (excluding) the first blank cell; if the whole nonnegative half-tape is
  blank-free (possible for an arbitrary configuration, though not for one reachable from an
  initial configuration), the query is defined to be `[]`. [AB09] leaves the extraction
  convention implicit; this is one concrete faithful reading.
* **The answer step** changes only the state; heads and tapes stay put. Some texts
  instead erase the query tape on each answer. The two conventions are equivalent up to
  *polynomial* overhead, but **not** constant overhead: computing the parity of `n`
  distinct length-`n` queries takes `O(n)` steps with a persistent tape and `Ω(n²)`
  steps with auto-erasure (`audits/phase1-findings.md`, finding 3, case 12).
  Consequently, exact `DTIME`-level bounds must never be transferred across this
  convention; class-level results (`Pᴼ` etc.) are unaffected.
* `qYes`/`qNo` are ordinary states from the machine's point of view (its transition
  function handles them); only `qQuery` triggers special behavior. The machine may query
  repeatedly. This reading presumes the three special states are pairwise distinct,
  which the raw structure does not enforce (e.g. with `qYes = qQuery` the machine
  re-queries forever after a positive answer): results at the faithful interface assume
  `OracleTM.WellFormed`. Note that
  `q₀ = qQuery` is legitimate and deliberately allowed (the machine then submits the
  empty query on its first step).

## Main definitions

* `Turing.OracleTM` — the oracle machine. [AB09, Definition 3.4]
* `Turing.OracleTM.WellFormed` — the three special states are pairwise distinct; the
  standing hypothesis of the faithful interface (oracle complexity classes will require
  it).
* `Turing.OracleTM.step`, `Turing.OracleTM.runFrom` — semantics relative to an oracle.
* `Turing.OracleTM.ComputesInTime` — output and time bound relative to an oracle.
* `Turing.Action.extend`, `Turing.Action.mapState`, `Turing.Cfg.embedOracle`,
  `Turing.OracleTM.ofMultiTapeTM` — the embedding of plain machines as oracle machines
  that never query.
* `Turing.OracleTM.plainEmptyOracle` — the converse direction: an oracle machine run
  with the empty oracle, as a plain `k + 1`-tape machine in exact lockstep.

## Main results (sanity checks for the architecture)

* `Turing.OracleTM.step_eq_of_ne_qQuery` — away from `qQuery`, the step does not depend
  on the oracle.
* `Turing.OracleTM.ofMultiTapeTM_wellFormed` — the embedding produces well-formed
  machines.
* `Turing.OracleTM.runFrom_ofMultiTapeTM` — an embedded plain machine runs in lockstep
  with the original, under every oracle.
* `Turing.OracleTM.computesInTime_ofMultiTapeTM` — hence its input/output behavior and
  time bounds are oracle-independent and agree with the plain machine's.
* `Turing.OracleTM.runFrom_plainEmptyOracle` — the empty-oracle elimination runs in
  exact lockstep.
* `Turing.OracleTM.queryString_length_le` — in an initialized run, the query after `t`
  steps has length at most `t`.
* `Turing.OracleTM.runFrom_workTapes_blank` — in an initialized run, cells at distance
  `≥ t` are still blank after `t` steps; the certificate that the no-blank fallback in
  `queryString` is unreachable from initialization.

distinctness of the three special states: the raw structure allows them to coincide
(with degenerate behavior, e.g. `qYes = qQuery` re-queries forever after a positive
answer), and the faithful interface imposes `OracleTM.WellFormed`.

/-- Well-formedness of an oracle machine: the query state and the two answer states are
pairwise distinct. Without this, the advertised semantics degenerates: with
`qYes = qQuery` a positive answer re-queries the unchanged tape forever (a negative
answer may still reach a distinct `qNo` and halt normally), and with all three states
collapsed the machine loops once the common query state is reached (an initial state
elsewhere can still halt via the table without ever querying). Moreover `qYes = qNo`
alone makes the step function — hence every run — oblivious to the oracle. This is the
standing hypothesis of the faithful oracle interface —
oracle complexity classes will require it. `q₀ = qQuery` is deliberately allowed: such a
machine simply submits the empty query on its first step.

happened at a head position of absolute value at most `t - 1` (heads start at `0` and

**Proof sketch.** Simultaneous induction on `t` with the head-position bound
`|workTapePos i| ≤ t`: at `t = 0` all tapes are blank and heads are at `0`; an ordinary
step writes only at the *old* head position (of absolute value `≤ t`, hence `< t + 1`;

# Deciding languages and the classes DTIME

Languages are sets of binary strings, `Mathlib`'s `Language Bool`. A bundled finite
machine over the binary alphabet (`Turing.FinTM Bool`, tape alphabet
`Option Bool = {0, 1, blank}`) *decides* a language `L` in time `T` if on every input `x`
it halts within `T |x|` steps with the single-symbol output `[true]` if `x ∈ L` and
`[false]` otherwise. `DTIME T` is the class of languages decided in time `c · T` for some
constant `c`. [AB09, §1.6, Definition 1.12]

## Design and deviations from [AB09]

* [AB09] fixes the four-symbol alphabet `{▷, □, 0, 1}` for the definition and remarks the
  choice is immaterial. Our machines use the three-symbol tape alphabet
  `Option Bool = {0, 1, blank}` over bidirectional tapes, which need no start symbol
  ([AB09, Claim 1.8] direction). The alphabet-reduction theorem ([AB09, Claim 1.5],
  phase 2) will show that machines over any finite alphabet are simulated by binary ones
  with a constant-factor slowdown — absorbed by the `∃ c` in `DTIME` — so defining
  `DTIME` over binary machines loses no generality.
* Acceptance is by output (`[true]`/`[false]`), not by accepting states: the vendored
  model has a single halting state and distinguishes outcomes by output, which [AB09]
  does via the output tape as well.
* **The output tape is append-only** (the transition emits at most one symbol per step,
  and emitted symbols cannot be erased), whereas [AB09, §1.2] designates a read-write
  work tape as the output tape — [AB09, p. 19] itself lists write-only output among the
  benign model variations. The simulation (an extra work tape holding the tentative
  output, copied out before halting, with constant-factor overhead) is a phase-2
  obligation; until then, exact step counts must not be transported between the two
  conventions.
* **Initialization differs from [AB09]**: there are no start-marker (`▷`) cells — the
  bidirectional tapes make them unnecessary — and the input head begins on the first
  input symbol (on the boundary blank for empty input), with all work tapes blank.
* The constant `c` ranges over all of `ℕ`; `c = 0` yields the bound `0`, within which no
  machine can halt (the initial state is not the halting state), so it contributes
  nothing — this matches [AB09]'s `c > 0` without carrying a positivity side condition.

## Main definitions

* `Turing.FinTM.DecidesInTime` — `M` decides `L` within time `T`. [AB09, §1.6 with
  Definition 1.3]
* `Complexity.DTIME` — the class of languages decidable in time `c · T`.
  [AB09, Definition 1.12]

## Main results

* `Complexity.DTIME.mono` — `DTIME` is monotone in the time bound.
* `Complexity.DTIME_eq_empty_of_exists_zero` — a time bound that vanishes at some
  length has an empty class (every machine needs at least one step to halt).

# Time-constructible functions

A function `T : ℕ → ℕ` is *time constructible* if `T n ≥ n` and some machine computes,
on every input `x`, the binary representation of `T |x|` within at most
`c · (T |x| + 1)` steps for a positive constant `c`. [AB09, §1.3, with the audit-mandated
budget repair below.] Time constructibility rules out pathological time bounds. It is
needed when a machine must *generate* a step budget from its input length, as in the
hierarchy theorems; note that the timed universal machine of [AB09, p. 21] receives its
budget as an explicit extra input and needs no constructibility hypothesis.

## Design and deviations from [AB09]

* Binary representation is `Nat.bits` (little-endian, no leading `false`s), where [AB09]
  writes `⌞T(|x|)⌟` without fixing endianness. Nothing in Chapter 1 depends on the choice.
* **Deviation (audit-mandated).** [AB09] demands the computation run within exactly
  `T n` steps and then asserts that `n`, `n log n`, `n²`, `2ⁿ` are time constructible.
  The phase-1 external audit (`audits/phase1-findings.md`, finding 1, adversarial cases
  5-6) *proved the literal reading false in this model*: under the exact bound, the
  identity function — [AB09]'s own first example — is not time constructible (on the
  budget `T n = n`, the first transition on `[false]` and `[false, false]` is the same
  function call, and the length-1 budget forces it to halt with output `[true]`, which
  absorption then freezes at length 2), and even `T n = n + 1` fails by an append-only
  prefix argument. We therefore allow a positive constant factor on `T n + 1`, which
  suffices for every downstream use and restores the book's examples *after small-input
  normalization*: the literal `n · ⌈log₂ n⌉`, for instance, still violates `T n ≥ n` at
  `n = 1`, so such examples are stated with a `max`-with-`n` or `+ 1` normalization.
  Exact constants in downstream results must be derived from this form, not inherited
  from the strict reading.

each bit to the output tape (`O(log n)` steps) and halts. The total is at most

# The class P

`P` is the class of languages decidable in polynomial time: the union over `c` of
`DTIME (n^c + 1)`. [AB09, Definition 1.13, with the `+ 1` padding explained below —
every *positive*-degree component of the literal unpadded union is empty in this model,
since `n^c` vanishes at `n = 0` and no machine halts in zero steps; [AB09]'s union
ranges over `c ≥ 1`, so its literal reading is empty, while including degree `0` would
give exactly `DTIME 1` (in Lean `0 ^ 0 = 1`).]

## Design and deviations from [AB09]

* We take the union of `DTIME (fun n => n ^ c + 1)` over all `c : ℕ` where [AB09] writes
  `⋃_{c ≥ 1} DTIME(n^c)`. The `+ 1` repairs the empty-input degeneracy: a machine needs
  at least one step to halt, so for the degrees `d ≥ 1` of [AB09]'s union no language
  whatsoever is decided within `c · 0^d = 0` steps on the empty input, and the literal
  [AB09] definition would (vacuously) exclude even constant-time machines on that input. For `n ≥ 1` the bounds `c · (n^d + 1)` and
  `c' · n^d` sandwich each other, so this is the standard reading of the same class.
  Ranging over `c = 0` too is harmless: `n^0 + 1 = 2` is a constant bound, subsumed by
  larger `c`.

# Example: palindromes are decidable in linear time

The language `PAL` of binary palindromes is decidable in linear time, hence in `P`.
[AB09, Examples 1.1 and 1.4] This is the phase-1 sanity check that the model and class
definitions are *usable*: proving it requires constructing a concrete machine and running
the definitional semantics on it end to end.

## Deviations from [AB09]

* [AB09, Example 1.1] states "within `3n` steps". We state `PAL ∈ DTIME (n + 1)`: the
  `∃ c` in `DTIME` absorbs the leading constant, and the `+ 1` covers the empty input, on
  which every machine needs at least one step to halt (`3 · 0 = 0` is unachievable — the
  book ignores this degenerate case).

/-- Palindromes are decidable in linear time. [AB09, Examples 1.1 and 1.4]

**Proof sketch.** Adapt the machine of [AB09, Example 1.1] to our model (bidirectional
tapes, no start symbol, blank = `none`): a one-work-tape machine with states
`{copy, rewind, test}`.

1. *Copy* (`n + 1` steps): move the input head and the work head right in unison, copying
   each input symbol to the work tape, until the input head reads blank (one cell past the
   input). The work head now sits one cell right of the copied string.
2. *Rewind* (`n + 1` steps): move the input head left back to the left boundary cell while
   the work head stays put; then step the work head one cell left onto the last symbol.
3. *Test* (`n + 1` steps): move the input head right and the work head left in unison,
   comparing the input symbol against the work symbol. On a mismatch, emit `false` and
   halt. When the input head reads blank again (all positions matched), emit `true` and
   halt.

Each phase takes at most `n + 1` steps, so some constant `c` (e.g. `c = 4`) gives
`c · (n + 1) ≥ 3n + 3` total steps, witnessing the `DTIME (n + 1)` bound. The formal
proof constructs the machine's transition function explicitly and establishes the
three-phase invariants by induction on the step count. -/
