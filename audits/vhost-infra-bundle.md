# External audit pack — zone/virtual-input layer (§13), statement gate, tranche A-S1

Campaign: Arora-Barak chapters 3-4 (`AroraBarakChapters3-4Plan.md` §4b,
track A; design `machine-library-design.md` §13/§13a). The §13 statement
phase runs in two tranches; this round audits **A-S1, the virtual-input
half**: Z5 (the machine-agreement transfer, `Simulation.lean`, additive),
Z1 (`Build/VirtualInput.lean`, new), and the Z1 rider (four selected-tape
exports in `Build/Embed.lean`, skeleton-time proofs). The zone half
(Z2/Z3/Z4) follows as tranche A-S2 with its own gate. The gate closes on
zero blockers and zero majors (`workflow.md` §3), with the failure-mode-5
rule in force: a debt major closes only by explicit human acknowledgment.

Audited at commit `28a49d69` (branch `complexity/arora-barak-ch3-4`).
**The audit object is the statement surface**: 7 new definitions, 11
`sorry`d contracts (9 in `VirtualInput.lean`, 2 in `Simulation.lean`), and
4 skeleton-time-proved lemmas. The proofs that exist are kernel-checked;
hunt the five failure modes of `audits/TEMPLATE.md` (infidelity,
trivialization, unprovability, missing hypotheses, debt).

## Brief for the auditor

1. **Blind-restate every definition** from its body before reading its
   docstring, and report daylight: `MultiTapeTM.AgreeOn`; `vhostBuffer`/
   `vhostBank`/`vhostCap` (the `1 + m` and `(1 + m) + 1` layouts);
   `vhostCfg` (in particular the buffer-head convention — source input
   position **minus one** — and that a halted source maps to a halted
   host); `vhostEmitTM` (the clamped `virtualMove` discipline, the tag in
   control, the frozen native head, `q₀ = (M.q₀, true)`);
   `vhostSilentTM`/`vhostSilentCfg` (**the layer composing with itself**:
   `embedSilentTM (Fin.castAddEmb 1) (vhostCap m)` over `vhostEmitTM`).
   For the silent pair, verify the composition arithmetic yourself: the
   range of `Fin.castAddEmb 1` on `Fin (1+m)` misses **exactly** the
   capture tape, so the transport's ambient frame parameters
   (`fun _ _ => none`, `fun _ => 0`) are inert — confirm or exhibit a tape
   they touch.
2. **Argue each of the 11 sorried statements true as literally stated**,
   or exhibit the problem. The binding inherited contracts are the A2/F2
   audit clauses (attached `batchF2A2-REPORT.md` and the F2 findings'
   forwarding ledger): both boundary clamps with **no nonempty-`y`
   premise**, halt absorption, the source's halting emission executed
   before the control dies, coefficient-one space on the hosted bank. The
   named fill template is the proved
   `Turing.FinTM.bufferedSecondCfg_step`/`_run` — compare statement shapes
   and flag any weakening (note the visited-set statements claim
   **equality**, not containment).
3. **Adversarial instantiations** (at least eight): `y = []` (boundaries
   adjacent — both clamps, tag at `p.val = 1` forced `true`); `m = 0` (a
   bank-free source: the host is one buffer tape); `t = 0`; an initially
   halted `c`; a source action attempting the outward move at each
   boundary under each tag; the emitting halting step (does
   `vhostEmitTM_emitting_halt`'s output parse `(pre ++ c.output) ++ [bit]`
   match the step identity?); native `x = []` (`p : Fin 2`); nonempty
   `pre`/`capPre`. For Z5: `Q = ∅`, `Q = Set.univ`, a run that halts
   before `t`, machines agreeing nowhere outside `Q`.
4. **Z5 strength check against its named customers** (design §13 Z5;
   evidence attached in `retrofit-inventory/loop.md`): the forwarding loop
   host agrees with the capturing host on every non-body state — is
   `AgreeOn` + `runFrom_eq_of_agreeOn`'s visit hypothesis (`∀ u < t`,
   live states in `Q`) sufficient to collapse the fourteen re-proved phase
   lemmas, and sufficient for the guarded `clSlot_run`-style sites, or do
   those need a per-configuration (not per-state) agreement form? If the
   statement is too weak for the named customers, that is a major.
5. **The four rider lemmas** (`embedSilentCfg_selected_tape`/`_pos`,
   `embedEmitCfg_selected_tape`/`_pos`): skeleton-time proofs, flagged —
   blind-restate them and confirm they are the selected-tape projections
   the three retrofit inventories requested (the D-R1 blocker), and that
   their statements expose nothing beyond the transports' fields.
6. **Space-ledger shapes**: `vhostEmitTM_spaceUsed_le`'s constant
   (`y.length + 2`) and the silent bound's capture term
   (`(capPre ++ (M.runFrom c t).output).length + 1`) — right constants,
   right horizon, coefficient one on `M.spaceUsed`? The intended consumer
   of the silent ledger is the `NP^EXPCOM ⊆ EXP` query simulation; flag a
   shape that consumer cannot use.
7. **Debt screen (failure mode 5)**: this tranche must add **no new
   copies** of existing proved material. The five prior private
   re-derivations (`bufferedCompTM` phase two aside, which is public and
   stays) remain in place pending the recorded 12.2c dedup — verify the
   new file *defines* rather than copies (the transformer is new public
   surface; its contracts cite, not restate, `virtualMove_correct`), and
   verify the maintainer's ledger line below.
8. Report anything the statements misstate, in the standard table and
   severity scale; propose any missing machine-checkable sanity theorem
   (candidates you should weigh: an `initCfg`-free statement that the
   `q₀` tag claim in `vhostEmitTM`'s docstring is actually consumed
   nowhere; a `vhostCfg` injectivity/ext lemma; the emit flavor's
   `visitedByTapeHead` for the *native* input — note the native head is
   frozen by the run identity).

## Known deviations and declared anomalies (verify they are benign)

* The four rider lemmas are **proved at statement time** (rfl-grade at the
  private `embedSlot_selected`), keeping the closed `Embed.lean`
  zero-sorry; precedent: the P3.1/P4.1 skeleton-time proofs.
* `vhostSilentTM` is a **definition by composition**, not a bespoke
  machine; its two contracts are deliberately stated on the composite and
  sketched as two-layer citations. If you judge the composite statements
  underdetermined (e.g. the inert-frame analysis fails), that is a major.
* `Simulation.lean` crosses the size policy line at 1,005 lines; the
  justification (decision 13.5, additive growth, D7 split window) is
  recorded in the plan's decision log.
* The `q₀ := (M.q₀, true)` tag is asserted valid at the canonical start
  position in a docstring; no contract consumes `q₀`. Flag if any
  statement silently depends on it.

## Repository-side attestations (verify or challenge)

* Elaboration: `Simulation`, `Build/Embed`, `Build/VirtualInput` all check
  with exit 0, zero `error:` lines, fresh `.olean`s; exactly **11**
  `declaration uses 'sorry'` warnings (9 + 2); `Embed.lean` remains
  zero-sorry.
* Style lint: 0 FAIL over both directories; the one new WARN
  (`Simulation.lean` size) is justified as above; every `sorry` carries a
  literal **Proof sketch**.
* **Duplication ledger (failure mode 5): new copies — none.** The file
  defines new public surface; the five in-repo precedents are untouched
  and queued for 12.2c.
* Base: the statements were landed in one maintainer commit at
  `28a49d69`; no other file changed.

# Formalization Plan: Arora-Barak Chapters 3-4 — Diagonalization and Space Complexity

**Status: draft for maintainer review (2026-10-08).** Nothing below is decided until the
open questions in §7 are answered; the decision log (§8) records every row as *Proposed*.

Continuation of the Arora-Barak campaign (`AroraBarakChapter1Plan.md`,
`AroraBarakChapter2Plan.md`, both closed), now working from `main`: branch
`complexity/arora-barak-ch3-4`, created from `origin/main` at `99b187fc`. The methodology
is unchanged (`workflow.md`): audited statement phases with proof sketches,
cross-vendor LLM audit gates closing on zero blockers/majors, then fill epochs of
disjoint-ownership batches with zip delivery, drift attestations, and a blueprint
increment at closure. Artifact names: `audits/ch3-*`, `audits/ch4-*`, `briefs/ch3-*`,
`briefs/ch4-*`.

**What changed since Chapter 2.** Much of this plan's raw material already exists on
`main`, written by Hydroxyi (commit `f70c57c2`, 2026-10-06, sorry-free) — notably a time
hierarchy theorem, `P ⊊ EXP`, `SPACE`/`LOGSPACE`, implicitly logspace functions,
`LOGSPACE ⊆ P`, and a logspace register-machine compiler. The plan therefore starts with
a *reception* phase (§4, P0) that brings that surface under the campaign's audit, and
builds Chapter 4 on Hydroxyi's program layers rather than on hand-built machines.

## 1. Scope

first candidates to descope), **deferred** (backlog).

## 2. Foundation decisions (proposed; each is seeded to the relevant audit)

### 2.1 Thm 3.1 is received at `f²` strength, then strengthened to book form

Hydroxyi's theorem consumes the linear-time `Turing.universal` over one-work-tape codes,
so converting an arbitrary machine to that normal form costs a square. The book's
`f log f` needs the Hennie-Stearns `O(T log T)` simulation ([AB09] §1.7), which the
Chapter-1 plan deferred as phase 5. The received form still yields `P ⊊ EXP`, but **not**
the book's illustrative `DTIME(n) ⊊ DTIME(n^1.5)`, since `n²` exceeds `n^1.5`.

**Decision (user, 2026-10-08, CH34-Q3): strengthen.** Before the chapter-3/4 fill
epochs, the campaign builds (a) the Hennie-Stearns `k`-work-tapes-to-2 conversion at
`C·T log T` ([AB09] §1.7: parallel tracks, buffer zones of size `2^i`, amortized
shifts), and (b) a universal machine over *two-work-tape* codes at linear overhead.
Hydroxyi's diagonal argument then re-derives Thm 3.1 at `f log f`, and Theorem 1.9
reaches book strength, closing chapter 1's deferred phase 5. Until that lands, the
received form is documented as delivered strength, never as Thm 3.1 verbatim. Both
constructions are consumers of the machine-routine layer (§4a).

### 2.2 Oracle classes

- **A finite bundle `FinOracleTM`** carrying `Fintype`/`DecidableEq` for states, with
  `WellFormed` as a field. This is the Chapter-1 phase-1 obligation: "oracle complexity
  classes will introduce a finite oracle-machine bundle".
- **An oracle NDTM** combining the binary-choice NDTM with the oracle step. Def 3.4 says
  only that nondeterministic oracle machines are "defined similarly".
- **`Pᴼ` and `NPᴼ` mirror `P` and `NTIME`** literally: the same `c · T n` and
  `n^c + 1` normal forms, with all-branch halting for `NPᴼ`.
- **Query tape:** the existing persistent convention (no auto-erase). The Chapter-1
  obligation to prove polynomial equivalence with the auto-erased convention is scheduled
  only if some consumer imports an invariance; none in this plan does.
- **One general lemma does most of the light work:** `L ≤ₚ O ⇒ L ∈ Pᴼ`. It writes `f(x)`
  on the query tape, queries, and copies the answer. Ex 3.6(1), the `A` half of Thm 3.7,
  and `NP ⊆ P^SAT` all follow from it.

### 2.3 Baker-Gill-Solovay

- **The `B` half follows the book.** `U_B ∈ NP^B` is a small oracle-NDTM construction.
  `U_B ∉ P^B` is the stage construction. It is mathematics, not machine-building: runs
  that agree on every queried string agree (by lockstep); a run of `t` steps queries at
  most `t` strings, each of length at most `t` (`queryString_length_le` exists); and
  `FinOracleTM`s can be enumerated with every machine recurring infinitely often, through
  `Fintype.equivFin` plus state relabelling, with no universal oracle machine needed.
- **The `A` half takes the book's route: `A = EXPCOM`** (user decision 2026-10-08,
  CH34-Q4 — preferred as the more natural oracle, with `P^EXPCOM = NP^EXPCOM = EXP` the
  memorable byproduct), via the chain `EXP ⊆ P^EXPCOM ⊆ NP^EXPCOM ⊆ EXP` (Ex 3.6(3)).
  - `EXP ⊆ P^EXPCOM`: the reduction `x ↦ ⟨M_L, x, 1^(n+1)^c⟩` (constant prefix, copy,
    unary padding emitter — chapter-2 padding-cluster precedents), then one query
    through the §2.2 lemma.
  - `NP^EXPCOM ⊆ EXP` is **a fill summit**: for each language, a deterministic
    exponential-time machine that enumerates all choice words of the fixed oracle NDTM
    (the `NP_subset_EXP` enumerator pattern), simulates it step by step under each word
    (2B-style invariant), and answers each query `⟨M', x', 1^(n')⟩` by parsing it
    (CodeParser) and running the timed universal machine for `2^(n')` steps (the
    `timed_universal` bridge), under a `2^O(p(n))` ledger. Continuation budget certain.
  - The machine-light alternative — [BGS75, Thm 1]'s own self-referential
    `A = K(A) = {⟨i, x, 0ⁿ⟩ : NPᵢᴬ accepts x in < n steps}`, well-founded because a
    `< n`-step run queries only shorter strings — is **recorded as the fallback**: if
    the summit stalls, switching requires only the oracle-locality lemma (needed for
    the `B` half anyway) plus a maintainer sign-off, and the blueprint would cite
    [BGS75, Thm 1] with a deviation note.

### 2.4 Space

- **Reuse `SPACE` and `LOGSPACE` unchanged**: deterministic, halting, counting visited
  work cells summed over the work tapes, with input and output excluded. [AB09] is itself
  inconsistent here: Def 4.1 counts *visited* cells for `SPACE` but *non-blank* cells for
  `NSPACE`. The vendored `Deterministic.lean` docstring and `SpaceComplexity/Basic.lean`
  currently disagree about what [AB09] says. P0 fixes the documentation, and the visited
  measure is used for both classes.
- **`NSPACE` (CH34-Q7, provisional answer: all branches halt).** It needs a new NDTM space
  measure along `runWith`, adapting the `visitedByTapeHead` pattern to choice words.
  Provisionally, `N` decides `L` in space `s` if on every input there is some `T` with
  `HaltsWithin x T`, every choice word stays within `s(|x|)` cells, and `x ∈ L` iff some
  choice word accepts. All-branch halting matches `NTIME`, lax-434930's convention and
  Remark 4.3's alternative, and it makes the configuration-count arguments direct.
- **Space-constructibility mirrors `TimeConstructible`.** A machine writes
  `(S |x|).bits` within space `c · (S |x|)`, and the definition carries
  `∀ n, logSpace n ≤ S n`, which is [AB09]'s standing `S(n) > log n` (p. 79).
  Theorems needing only weaker hypotheses say so. This is seeded to the P4.1 audit.
- **The classes:** `PSPACE := ⋃ c, SPACE (n^c + 1)`, and likewise `NPSPACE`;
  `NL := NSPACE logSpace`; `coNL` in complement form, like `coNP`.
- **Positive bounds everywhere (P0 round 1, finding 1).** Unnormalized `SPACE s`
  collapses to the zero-work-tape class as soon as `s` has one zero (every machine has
  `k ≤ spaceUsed`), so **every asymptotic chapter statement uses an everywhere-positive
  bound** (`n + 1`, `n^c + 1`, `logSpace`) — never a literal `fun n => n`. The collapse
  and the harmless-normalization identities are stated as the sanity layer
  `SpaceComplexity/ZeroSpace.lean` (S1-S4; elaborated, proofs deferred to fill,
  each certified true as stated by the P0 round-2 audit); the same applies verbatim to
  `NSPACE` (branch space also dominates the tape count).
- **`≤ₗ` reuses `ImplicitlyLogspaceComputable`** (Def 4.16, with its documented
  divergences: `C(|x|+1)^c` length bound and 0-based index).

### 2.5 Machine substrate for Chapter 4: program layers, not hand-built machines

Chapter 2's lesson, and the backlog's machine-routine-layer entry, is that hand-built
machines dominate the cost. For space the relevant layers already exist on `main`:

- **`LogProg.ARM`** (`SpaceComplexity/Machines/`) is an abstract register machine with
  `O(log n)`-bit registers and calls to `LOGSPACE` deciders. It compiles to `FinTM` with a
  space theorem (`compile_space`, `arm_decides`, `arm_decides_poly`). It is
  **deterministic only**.
- **`CounterProg`** (`TuringMachine/CounterProg{,Run}.lean`) has unary registers and
  forward input reading. It compiles with a time bound (`t` steps become at most
  `t(2t+3)`), so it suits the `2^O(S)`-time searches, where register values of size
  `2^O(S)` are affordable. Its input is one-way (`rd` only advances), but a configuration
  successor must read the input at the simulated head. Those searches therefore need
  either ARM-style indexed input access or a rewind instruction.

Proposed extensions, each a P4.x infrastructure statement with its own audit:

1. **A nondeterministic ARM**: a `choose` instruction compiling to `FinNDTM`, with the
   space theorem carried over. This serves `PATH ∈ NL`, Immerman-Szelepcsényi and
   Cor 4.21.
2. **A polynomial-width ARM variant** with registers of `poly(n)` bits, for the
   `PSPACE`-level algorithms: `TQBF ∈ PSPACE`, `NP ⊆ PSPACE`, Savitch at polynomial
   level. It is either a generalization of `compile_space` or a sibling.
3. **A configuration codec**, shared by Thm 4.2(iii), Savitch, Thm 4.18, Cor 4.21 and
   `TQBF` hardness. It encodes the configurations of a fixed machine, with work tapes
   windowed to `s` cells and the input head as a separate register, as `O(s)`-bit
   register contents, and provides a successor/adjacency test as a program. The counting
   half adapts cslib's new upstream `MultiTape/ConfigBound.lean` design (Sept 2026,
   `Storage`/`Cfg.core`) and extends Hydroxyi's deterministic `ConfigCount` to NDTMs.
   It must be cited and adapted, not vendored: cslib targets a newer Lean with the
   module system.

This requires Hydroxyi's agreement, since these are their modules (CH34-Q2).

### 2.6 Formulas and graphs

- **The QBF matrix (CH34-Q5).** Def 4.10 allows a general unquantified matrix; we have
  only `Std.Sat.CNF ℕ` and the DNF dual. Provisional choice: prenex QBF with a **CNF
  matrix**, reusing the CNF carrier, serialization and parser. [AB09] notes on p. 83 that
  the CNF restriction is harmless via auxiliary variables, so `TQBF` hardness pays a
  Tseitin step. A general-formula carrier is the alternative, which Chapter 5 and a
  general `TAUTOLOGY` would also want.
- **`PATH` needs the campaign's first graph encoding**: an adjacency-matrix
  serialization plus `s`, `t` in binary via `pairEncode`, with a parser and the
  `codeFallback`-style totalization. It stays in-house in `Complexity/`, with
  `GraphTheory.Digraph.Reachable` as the semantic target.

### 2.7 Universal machines

- **Thm 4.8 needs a space-efficient universal machine (Ex 4.1).** The existing `universal`
  and `timed_universal` are time-only, and their code scheme covers only the
  one-work-tape binary normal form. So either the Chapter-1 robustness conversions
  (`one_work_tape`, alphabet reduction) gain space theorems, or a fresh space-universal
  machine takes multi-tape codes. This is the largest single risk in Chapter 4 (§6).
- **Thm 3.2 needs NDTM codes and a clocked universal NDTM (Ex 2.6), at linear
  overhead** (user decision 2026-10-08, CH34-Q8). Polynomial overhead would deliver only
  `f(n+1)^c = o(g(n))`; linear overhead gives the book's `f(n+1) = o(g(n))`. The
  guess-then-verify technique (guess the whole tableau of choice/configuration data,
  then check each tape's consistency in one pass — Book-Greibach style) achieves a
  code-dependent constant factor, which is the strongest form possible: a simulation of
  `t` steps cannot run faster than the `t` steps it reproduces, and the code-dependent
  constant is necessary for the same reason as chapter 1's Argument E. Another
  routine-layer consumer.

Chapter-1/2 files stay frozen at their audited surface. Additions to Hydroxyi's trees
follow whatever ownership rule CH34-Q2 sets.

## 4. Phasing

Statement phases, each gated by an audit before the next one lands. The order reflects
infrastructure dependencies and retires risk early: the light half of Chapter 3, then
Chapter 4, then Chapter 3's two heavy diagonalizations.

| Phase | Contents | New sorried statements (est.) |
|---|---|---|
| **P0 — Reception** | Statements-only audit of the existing surface the campaign will build on: `time_hierarchy`, `P_ssubset_EXP`, `SPACE`, `LOGSPACE`, `ImplicitlyLogspaceComputable`, `LOGSPACE_subset_P`, `ComputesInTime.of_spaceUsed_le`, and the `arm_decides` and `compile_space` contracts. Docstring fixes (the §2.4 inconsistency; the stale "spec phase, sorried" notes in `Build/*`). Drift baseline recorded. No new sorries. | 0 |
| **P3.1 — Oracle classes** | `FinOracleTM`, the oracle NDTM, `Pᴼ`, `NPᴼ`; `P ⊆ Pᴼ`, `NPᴼ` contains `Pᴼ`; the `≤ₚ ⇒ Pᴼ` lemma; Ex 3.6(1)(2); `NP ⊆ P^SAT` as a sanity theorem | ~10 |
| **P3.2 — Relativization** | Oracle-machine enumeration; `U_B ∈ NP^B`; the stage construction; the EXPCOM cluster (`EXPCOM`, `EXP ⊆ P^EXPCOM`, `NP^EXPCOM ⊆ EXP`, `P^EXPCOM = NP^EXPCOM = EXP` — Ex 3.6(3)); Thm 3.7; Ex 3.5 | ~11 |
| **P4.1 — Space classes** | NDTM space measure, `NSPACE`, space-constructibility, the classes; Thm 4.2(i)(ii); `L ⊆ NL`; `3SAT ∈ PSPACE`, `NP ⊆ PSPACE`; `EVEN`, `MULT ∈ L`; the nondeterministic and polynomial-width ARM interfaces | ~14 |
| **P4.2 — Configuration graphs** | The configuration codec; Claim 4.4(1) for NDTMs; Thm 4.2(iii); Savitch; `PSPACE = NPSPACE`; `NL ⊆ P`; Ex 4.3 | ~10 |
| **P4.3 — `PSPACE`-completeness and space hierarchy** | Def 4.9; the QBF carrier, `TQBF`, Claim 4.4(2), Thm 4.13 (both halves); the space-universal machine (Ex 4.1); Thm 4.8; `L ⊊ PSPACE`; Ex 3.2; Ex 4.10 | ~12 |
| **P4.4 — Logspace and `NL`** | `≤ₗ`, `NL`-completeness, Lemma 4.17; the graph encoding, `PATH ∈ NL`, Thm 4.18; Thm 4.20; Cor 4.21 | ~10 |
| **P3.3 — Nondeterministic hierarchy** | NDTM codes, the clocked universal NDTM (Ex 2.6), Thm 3.2 at delivered strength | ~6 |
| **P3.4 — Ladner** | `SAT_H`; Ex 3.6(a) (`H` in polynomial time); the Claim; Ex 3.6(b); Thm 3.3 | ~6 |

That is roughly 78 new audited statements, against Chapter 2's 59.

### 4a. Pre-campaign infrastructure (user decisions 2026-10-08)

The machine-routine layer and its two headline consumers run **in parallel with the
statement phases**, and gate only the fill epochs:

1. **The routine layer** (`machine-library-design.md` §12, to be written): bank
   embedding, seam composition, catalog promotion — **scoped to amply support the
   chapter-1/2 retrofit**, not just the new consumers. Its catalog therefore covers the
   privately re-derived bank / relocation / dispatch / frame families of `Build/*`,
   `Universal*`, and `CookLevin/Hardness.lean` (the backlog retrofit entry's list), and
   **every routine carries a space cost alongside its time cost** from the start, so
   chapter 4 and the space statements (P4.x) can consume it without a second pass. The
   P0/P4.1 space statements are drafted while the layer is being designed, precisely so
   they can inform what else the layer needs (CH34-Q1).
2. **Hennie-Stearns + the two-work-tape universal machine** (§2.1): the layer's first
   new consumers, giving Thms 1.9 and 3.1 at book strength. The two-tape universal is a
   rewrite of `Universal.lean`, making it the natural retrofit pilot. Candidate bonus,
   to be checked at design time: carrying space bounds through it may also yield the
   space-efficient universal machine that Thm 4.8 needs (Ex 4.1).
3. **The chapter-1/2 retrofit** itself is *not* a gate for chapters 3-4: public surfaces
   are frozen, so retrofit batches run alongside the chapter-3/4 phases under the
   standard sweep + traversal + audit protocol.

**Fill campaign.** Fill work starts after the gates close, in epochs ordered by risk as
before. Two infrastructure prerequisites gate the machine-heavy epochs:

- the machine-routine layer as scoped above;
- the ARM extensions of §2.5.

**Integration with `main`.** Proposed: one PR per closed chapter (Chapter 3's light half
may go earlier), not one campaign-sized PR like #3. Main's CI runs only on pushes to
`main`, so each PR carries the local evidence: sweep, axiom prints, and the blueprint web
build.

### 4b. Post-statement-program roadmap (recorded 2026-10-09; user-directed)

Recorded at the close of the statement program — every statement gate shut
(P0, P3.1-P3.3, P4.1-P4.4, §12; decision log) — with roughly 150
audited-true sorried statements frozen and the carried obligations
collected in the nine `audits/*-resolutions.md` files. The remaining
stages, in order:

1. **Fill prerequisites** (gate the machine-heavy epochs, per §4a):
   - the **§12 routine-layer fill** (56 statements; partition in §4c) —
     the engine nearly every chapter-3/4 sketch names;
   - the **ARM extensions** (§2.5: nondeterministic and polynomial-width
     program layers; first customers the `PATH` walk and the counting
     verifier) — the open **colleague-sync item** on Hydroxyi's `LogProg`
     tree;
   - **Hennie-Stearns + the two-work-tape universal** (§2.1, CH34-Q3):
     Thms 1.9/3.1 to book strength; the retrofit pilot; candidate bonus:
     space bounds through it may yield Ex 4.1's space-efficient universal
     for the Thm 4.8 fill.
2. **The fill epochs** (`workflow.md` §4): sequential, risk-ordered,
   parallel disjoint-ownership batches from `briefs/`, epoch-boundary
   audits. Summit order per §6: the space-universal + Thm 4.8; the
   `NP^EXPCOM ⊆ EXP` simulator; the `TQBF` `ψᵢ` emitter; the
   linear-overhead universal NDTM; Thm 4.2(iii) + Savitch; Immerman-
   Szelepcsényi; Lemma 4.17. (Ladner's `H` rides with P3.4.)
3. **P3.4 (Ladner)** — on hold (user, 2026-10-09); drafts from the
   backlog §2 entry whenever called, independent of the fills.
4. **The chapter-1/2 retrofit** — not a gate; batches alongside the
   epochs. Queued housekeeping with it: the per-theme `Catalog` split
   (12.2c), the P3.1 natural-home promotions (unblocked), the additive
   sanity layers (`NSPACE` twins, `mem_NL_of_logspaceReducible`,
   `Cfg.InWindow` promotion).
5. **Closure** (`workflow.md` §5): zero-sorry sweep, campaign-wide drift
   attestation, final audit pack, blueprint increment (late-bound).
6. **Integration with `main`**: one PR per closed chapter (chapter 3's
   light half may go early), each carrying sweep, axiom prints, and the
   blueprint build, since main's CI runs only on `main`.

### 4c. Routine-layer fill: epoch/batch partition (recorded 2026-10-09)

The §12 surface is three files, 56 audited-true statements (Embed 13,
Seam 11, Catalog 32). Exclusive file ownership (workflow §4, ground
rule 1) shapes the partition; the proof plans inherited from the audit
loop (`audits/routine-infra-{findings,r2-findings,r3-findings}.md`,
summarized in `audits/routine-infra-resolutions.md`) make this the
best-documented fill surface of the campaign.

**Epoch F1 — kernels and routines (3 parallel batches, 37 targets).**

| Batch | Owns | Targets | Contents and risk notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1A | `Build/Embed.lean` | 13 | The `embedSlot` equations and one-step commutation core first, then the four flavor families: silent lockstep/frame/visited/cap (5), emit lockstep/frame/visited (4), the returning through-halt contracts and visited equalities (4). The round-3 report's five-step induction (component check, `Option.elim` successor equations, last-step case) is the mandated proof plan for the returning pair; the `hc ↔ 0 < T` equivalence uses both first-halt hypotheses |
| F1B | `Build/Seam.lean` | 11 | The **general-configuration trio first** (`_ofCfg` run / first-return / visited — the round-2/3 reports verify the lockstep decomposition and the `(Cfg.ofWords q w).mapState f = Cfg.ofWords (f q) w` identity), then the three canonical statements **as instances** (F1 audit, finding 1: 3+3+2+1+2 = 11), the two additive and one max space corollaries by projection, and the release pair (fresh-step equation + `Sum.inr` lockstep) |
| F1C | `Build/Catalog.lean` | 13 | Part 1: the five routines' 11 run/space contracts — the round-1 report's exact movement table (forward `L`/`d`/`p`, one turn, return, one entry; visited exactly `[-1, ·]`) is the mandated ledger, including equal-word compare, aliased indices, and the `2p + 2` increment count — plus W1 (`capture_visitedByTapeHead`, prefix-by-prefix over `capture_run`) and W2 (`redirectTM_spaceUsedByTape`, trajectory agreement through and past the halt) |

No F1 batch consumes another's file or fills; Part-1 routines are
self-contained transition inductions. Epoch-boundary audit after F1.

**Epoch F2 — the space annotations (1 batch, 19 targets, Catalog-owned).**

| Batch | Owns | Targets | Contents and risk notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| F2A | `Build/Catalog.lean` | 19 | The Part-2 rows, risk-ordered: (i) same-witness constant rows (`id`, `const`, `prepend`, `pairEncodeFixed`, `pairValid`, `pairDup`, `incFixed`); (ii) same-witness linear rows (`pairFst`, `pairSnd`, `pairConcat`); (iii) the case-split rows (`polyUnary`; `polyBits` with the **mandatory `C = 0` / `e = 0` constant-witness splits**, round-1 R5); (iv) `lengthBits` (the direct variable-width-counter construction — the imported sharp witness is explicitly not relied on), `pairLenCheck`, `stripLast` (linear banks; quadratic time is slack), `splitSolve`; (v) `cond` (W3: disjoint decider/branch banks) and `exists_loopTM_spaceUsed` (L: the round-1 answer-5 ledger — interval-union argument, fuel width `\|bits (R n)\|`, no per-round accumulation); (vi) **`pairMapSnd` last — the epoch summit and the only new machine of the fill**: the commissioned forwarding controller (validate/buffer, emit prefix, forward payload output; coefficient 1 on `Sg`; the round-2 R4 ledger), with the captured-payload witness disclaimed. Continuation brief anticipated |

F2 follows F1 so its constructions may consume proved F1 seams, though
none is required to. Epoch-boundary audit after F2 closes the §12 fill;
the S1-S12 sanity statements of the round-1 report are offered to both
epochs as optional permanent lemmas, landing wherever their batch owns.

**Ground rules** as `workflow.md` §4 (exclusive ownership, statement
freeze with escalation on unprovable-as-stated, per-batch sweeps over the
owned file, zip delivery with freeze verification, `git am -3`
integration). Every brief embeds its inherited audit material verbatim:
the movement tables (F1C), the through-halt induction (F1A), the general-
seam decomposition (F1B), and the R4/R5/answer-5 ledgers (F2A).

### 4d. Chapter-1/2 retrofit: inventories, partition, decisions (recorded 2026-10-09)

Three commissioned read-only inventories (verbatim under
`audits/retrofit-inventory/{primitives,loop,hardness}.md`; source-text
liveness — token matching, comments stripped, reachability from the public
declarations; deletion safety at integration is the compile sweep, since a
falsely-dead private fails loudly). Ground rules: the **strict-simplification
bar** (replace only where the citation is strictly simpler; non-canonical
seams are LEAVE), public surfaces byte-identical, the **`Universal*` cluster
excluded** (two-tape-universal pilot territory), and the **integration rule**:
retrofit output goes to a side branch and a PR into the campaign branch; the
user merges manually.

**What the inventories established.** The §12-shaped glue in the old files is
overwhelmingly **LEAVE** for structural reasons the agents verified against
the sources: the hosts are monolithic hand-built transition tables (R2
composes exactly two machines, has no back-edge, and cannot start inside a
phase); catalog rows are canonical-`Cfg.ofWords`-only; and R1 exports no
selected-tape facts (`embedSlot_selected`/`_unselected` are private) nor an
agreeing-host (`hagree`) lockstep. The realizable conservative scope is
dominated by **dead code** (76 privates, ≈1,505 lines — including
`emitterBank*`, the backlog's named R1 target, which was superseded rather
than consumed) plus a handful of clean replacements:

| Batch | File | Contents | Net impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **RB1** (maintainer-serial proposed) | `Build/Loop.lean` | 8 dead privates (the standalone debit machine F4 + 2 orphans); H4's local `emit_run` re-derivation → the now-proved `Turing.emit_run` + `leftCfg_run`; the stale docstring sentence at 2205 | ≈ −200 lines |
| **RB2** (one external batch) | `Build/Primitives.lean` | 62 dead privates (the superseded emitter batch F24a–f + 3 split orphans); `emitterCompare*` → `compareTM` and `emitterP2Erase*` → `clearTM` (both seams verified canonical, glue itemized in the inventory); the two `Encoding.lean` duplicate swaps; the three stale comment blocks. **Optional stretch (D-R2(c))**: derive `splitSolve` from `splitSolveWith` + `polyBits` (−38 more privates, ≈ −909 lines, one new bound proof, no new import) | ≈ −1,520 lines (−2,430 with the stretch) |
| **RB3** (maintainer-serial proposed) | `CookLevin/Hardness.lean` | 6 dead privates; `clCompute_comp` → the public composition row; `clBuffer_append_bit` → `bufferTape_append`; `clA5_pt_unaryLength` → `clNative_fill true`; `clFresh*` → R2 (seams match `seamCompTM_run_ofCfg` exactly, no glue); the `clCount_width` docstring fix | ≈ −190 lines |

All three batches are file-disjoint and can run in parallel; each ships with
the full verification protocol (public-surface byte-identity, fresh sweeps,
axiom prints of the file's publics unchanged, lint) on its side branch.
Honest total: ≈ **−98 privates / −1,900 lines** — consistent with the
recorded expectation that the retrofit's payoff is hygiene and idiom, not
transformation; the five theorems of Hardness lose at most ~6% of their file
even in the best case.

**Decisions (user):**
- **D-R1 — R1 selected-tape exports.** All three inventories independently
  hit the same blocker: `Embed.lean` exports no selected-tape field lemmas
  and no agreeing-host lockstep. Adding them is additive Embed surface
  growth and unlocks ≈ −300–350 further lines in Hardness (families M/N/AM/U
  and the Z/AB/AG glue) and the strongest Loop/Primitives R1 candidates.
  **Proposed: fold into the §13 (Z1) statement phase** — same file family,
  same audit gate, one shared-file window instead of two.
- **D-R2 — Primitives ownership.** The inventory proved Catalog does *not*
  import Primitives: the catalog's rows rest on `f2_` copies of 150
  Primitives privates (147 byte-identical; correspondence mapped). Option
  (a) — import Catalog into Primitives (no cycle, verified) and project 11
  public rows from their twins — frees a further −100 privates/−2,370
  lines but inverts the layer's ownership; **proposed: defer (a) to the
  recorded 12.2c window** (feasibility now on record), take the (c) stretch
  inside RB2, and let 12.2c also consume the complete Loop↔Catalog
  correspondence map (95 privates, 92 byte-identical) the Loop inventory
  produced.
- **D-R3 — machine-agreement transfer lemma** (deferred candidate): Loop's
  largest duplication is internal (14 phase lemmas, ≈550 lines, re-proved
  verbatim for the forwarding host); an agreement-transfer lemma would
  collapse it and is the same `hagree` genre as D-R1. Weigh at the §13 spec
  phase; not part of this retrofit.

**D-R1 and D-R3 RESOLVED (user, 2026-10-09):** D-R1 — the R1 selected-tape
exports ride the §13 Z1 statement gate (additive `Embed.lean` growth,
recorded as the Z1 rider in `machine-library-design.md`); D-R3 — the
machine-agreement transfer lemma is **commissioned** as §13 item **Z5**
(the `hagree` lockstep made standalone; collapses Loop's ≈550-line
forwarding-host duplication and serves Hardness's 13 guarded agreement
sites; placement open decision 13.5).

**D-R2 RESOLVED (user, 2026-10-09):** conservative RB2 plus the stretch
(c) (`splitSolve` via `splitSolveWith` — a logical subsumption that
survives any layout); **no option (a)** (a half-measure 12.2c would
churn); and **12.2c is PROMOTED** from "queued indefinitely" to **the next
window after the RB batches land** — the per-theme split making each
implementation live once with both its time and space contracts,
`Primitives.lean` and `Catalog.lean` reduced to facades re-exporting the
frozen public names, consuming the recorded dedup maps (Primitives↔Catalog
150 twins, Loop↔Catalog 95, the Wrappers copies), dropping the dead twins
on both sides, and folding in the F2-audit dedup assignments and the
queued `redirectTM` projection. 12.2c runs with its own audit gate under
the new duplication governance. **Sequencing amendment (user, 2026-10-09):**
the two RB2 catalog replacements (F25a `emitterCompare*` → `compareTM`,
F27a `emitterP2Erase*` → `clearTM`) **move out of RB2 into the 12.2c
window** — they require the Catalog→Primitives import that 12.2c redesigns,
and doing them first would wire and then rewire it. RB2 is thereby purely
layout-independent (deletions, in-file swaps, the stretch), ≈ −1,260 lines
(−2,170 with the stretch); RB1/RB3 unchanged and churn-free against 12.2c
(RB1's edits survive any later layout verbatim; Hardness is untouched by
12.2c). Order confirmed: **RB1 ∥ RB2 ∥ RB3 → 12.2c** (dead code dies
before anything moves; the split runs on the shrunken files per its
recorded precondition; the structural change gets its own clean review).
Retrofit epoch **R1** = the three batches, briefs
`briefs/retrofit-rb{1,2,3}.md`.
| **§13 decisions 13.1-13.5 resolved; track A opens in two tranches** (user, 2026-10-09): zones-with-fullness; paired presence/data cells; new file renamed **`Codes2Tape.lean`**; Z1 mode shape inherits 12.4 (silent/emit pair over one core); Z5 in `Simulation.lean`. Statement phase split (`machine-library-design.md` §13a): **A-S1** = the virtual-input half (Z5 + Z1 + the Z1 rider — harvest-grade, near-term consumers: the blocked retrofit R1 families, 12.2c, Loop H3, EXPCOM) then its gate; **A-S2** = the zone half (Z2 + Z3 + Z4 — the carrier is the design risk and gets an undiluted gate; the Ex 4.1 bonus check discharges in its pack). Z1 canonical shape recorded: `1 + M.k` tapes (buffer first), relocation by R1 composition, never baked in. A-S1 spec layer is maintainer-serial, in progress | Decided |
| **A-S1 spec layer LANDED** (maintainer-serial, 2026-10-09): **Z5** — `MultiTapeTM.AgreeOn` + `step_eq_of_agreeOn`/`runFrom_eq_of_agreeOn` appended to `Simulation.lean` (2 sorried; the file crosses the 600/1000 policy line at 1,005 lines — **justification recorded here**: decision 13.5 fixed Z5's home beside the lockstep gadgets it generalizes, the growth is 57 additive lines, and any split belongs to the queued D7 window); **Z1 rider** — four selected-tape projections (`embedSilentCfg_selected_tape`/`_pos`, `embedEmitCfg_selected_tape`/`_pos`) added to `Embed.lean` as **skeleton-time proofs** (rfl-grade at the private `embedSlot_selected`; Embed stays zero-sorry; flagged for the A-S1 audit); **Z1** — new `Build/VirtualInput.lean` (323 lines): `vhostCfg` transport, `vhostEmitTM` (canonical `1+m` layout, tag in control, `q₀` tag `true`), and **`vhostSilentTM` defined as the layer composing with itself** (`embedSilentTM` of `vhostEmitTM` at `castAddEmb` with one appended capture tape — no third lockstep), plus 9 sorried contracts with sketches naming `bufferedSecondCfg_step`/`_run` as the fill template: step/run lockstep (no liveness/nonemptiness premises), bank visited **equality**, buffer-trajectory equality, the clamp-interval and emitting-halt **permanent regression lemmas** (F2-audit-adopted), and the coefficient-one space ledgers for both flavors. Elaboration: all three modules exit 0, exactly 11 sorries (9+2), lint 0 FAIL. The A-S1 statement-gate pack follows | Recorded |

**Duplication-governance amendments landed (user-directed, 2026-10-09; from
the D-R2 post-mortem — the `f2_` accumulation was disclosed and recorded at
every step but never escalated to a human decision):** `audits/TEMPLATE.md`
failure mode 5 (**debt**, reported at major; gates cannot close over it
without explicit human acknowledgment; screened cumulatively);
`workflow.md` §4 duplication ledger at maintainer verification (hard
escalation threshold: one-fifth copied material, or repeat copies across
epochs, auto-opens a backlog §1 item) and in every epoch pack, auditor-
verified; `policy.md` **Duplication.** paragraph — forced or deliberate,
duplication of proved material is always disclosed, always ledgered,
**always human-approved**; undisclosed duplication is a freeze violation.
Campaign branch `2f61ef88`; **merged to `main` via PR #8** (single
cherry-picked commit, the PR #6/#7 precedent); all three files verified
byte-identical on both branches. Noted in passing: `main` has moved
substantially (colleague activity in `BooleanAnalysis/`) — relevant to the
pending colleague sync.

**Logged housekeeping (maintainer, not retrofit output):** stale "statement
skeleton / sorried" module headers in `Embed`/`Seam`/`Catalog` (all
zero-sorry since today); two library-docstring overclaims (Embed's R1 "is
the generic form of `clBank*`" — `clBankTM` is a simultaneous product, not
a relocation; Catalog's copy/compare row provenance wording vs
`clCopyTM`/`clCmpTM`'s actual semantics); bookkeeping corrections — the
generated-kernel-artifact count is 12 (in `Nondeterminism`/`EXP`/`SAT`, none
in Hardness), Hardness holds 553 privates (618 at A5 close − 65 at E5), and
two kernel-dead names (`clRefClockCfg`, `clReadFields`) are missing from the
E5 record.

## 5. Prior art to consult (design only; cite, never transcribe)

- **Édouard Bonnet's Lax Archive entries** (Lean 4.33, Mathlib `db584cd6`). They use a
  different machine model (stack machines, one work tape), so none of their code ports.
  - lax-434930 `classical-complexity` (commit `0c084031…`): `L ⊆ NL ⊆ P ⊆ NP ⊆ PSPACE =
    NPSPACE ⊆ EXPTIME`. Its space model counts every visited work cell, requires every
    branch to halt, and uses `c · log₂(n+2)`. It embeds the lax-307052 Savitch proof.
  - lax-362205 Immerman-Szelepcsényi (`EdouardBonnet/immerman-szelepcsenyi` @
    `e0ffe91e`): inductive counting on finite configuration graphs.
  - lax-783278 Arc Kayles: a machine-to-game `PSPACE`-hardness that bears on the shape of
    the `TQBF` hardness proof.
  - Licences: lax-434930 states Apache-2.0 for its incorporated helpers; the others' pages
    state none. Check each before any design adaptation, under the 2026-10-06 citation
    discipline.
- **cslib upstream** (`leanprover/cslib` `main`): `MultiTape/ConfigBound.lean` and
  `TapeLemmas.lean` (space-bounded configuration counting, `exists_spaceUsedByTape_max`).
  We already diverge from cslib's relational `MultiTapeNTM` (Chapter-2 decision log).
- **Szymon Toruńczyk, lax-218471**: compositional polynomial-time computation with
  black-box subroutines. It bears on the §2.2 `≤ₚ ⇒ Pᴼ` lemma and Ex 3.6(2).

## 6. Risks and honest effort assessment

- **Chapter 4 is the larger half**, and almost all of it is machine work with *space*
  ledgers. Every existing campaign construction (Chapters 1-2, `Build/*`) is time-only,
  and `machine-library-design.md` lists "no space bounds" among its non-goals. Building
  Chapter 4 on hand-built machines would repeat Chapter 2's cost profile several times
  over. The §2.5 program layers are the mitigation, and the plan depends on them.
- **The summits**, in rough order of size:
  1. the space-universal machine plus Thm 4.8 (or space theorems for the Chapter-1
     conversions);
  2. the `NP^EXPCOM ⊆ EXP` simulator (§2.3 — choice-word enumeration, per-step oracle
     NDTM simulation, and timed-universal query answering compounded in one machine);
  3. `TQBF` hardness (a polynomial-time emitter of the `ψᵢ` formula, comparable to the
     Cook-Levin emitter);
  4. Ladner's `H` in polynomial time;
  5. the universal NDTM at linear overhead (guess-then-verify, §2.7);
  6. Thm 4.2(iii) and Savitch over the configuration codec;
  7. Immerman-Szelepcsényi;
  8. Lemma 4.17.
- **Delivered-strength honesty**: Thms 3.1 and 3.2 land weaker than the book unless
  Hennie-Stearns is built. Every docstring must say so; this was the round-1 lesson of
  every prior audit.
- **Coordination**: Chapter 4 extends a colleague's live tree, and the plan needs their
  agreement before P4.1.
- **Estimated scale**: roughly 75 statements over eight statement phases plus P0. The
  total is larger than Chapter 2; Chapter 3 alone is comparable to Chapter 1.

## 7. Open design questions (human review required)

Answered 2026-10-08 by the maintainer except where marked open; the register below is
the record, and `backlog.md` §1 gets only the open ones.

1. **CH34-Q1 — sequencing against the machine-routine layer.** **Answered: yes to
   both.** Statement phases run in parallel with the §12 design; the space statements
   are drafted early to inform the layer's scope; the catalog records space costs
   alongside time. Addendum (same date): the layer is scoped to **amply support the
   chapter-1/2 retrofit** as well (§4a).
2. **CH34-Q2 — alignment with Hydroxyi.** **Answered: extend in place, co-owned.**
3. **CH34-Q3 — Thm 3.1 strength.** **Answered: strengthen** — Hennie-Stearns + the
   two-work-tape universal before the fill epochs (§2.1, §4a).
4. **CH34-Q4 — the `A` half of Thm 3.7.** **Answered (2026-10-08): the book's
   `EXPCOM` route** — more natural, and `P^EXPCOM = NP^EXPCOM = EXP` is the memorable
   identity; Ex 3.6(3) is core and `NP^EXPCOM ⊆ EXP` joins the summit list. Research
   note retained: the machine-light self-referential oracle is [BGS75, Thm 1]'s own
   proof (verified against the scanned original, pp. 433-434) and stays recorded as
   the fallback (§2.3). [BGS75] detail for the P3.1 audit: the polynomial clock must
   hold under *every* oracle, which constrains how `Pᴼ`/`NPᴼ` quantify the time bound.
5. **CH34-Q5 — QBF matrix.** **Answered: CNF.**
6. **CH34-Q6 — tiers.** **Answered: Thm 3.2 mandatory; Thm 3.3 (Ladner) core-late.**
7. **CH34-Q7 — `NSPACE` halting convention.** **Answered: all branches halt.**
8. **CH34-Q8 — universal-NDTM overhead.** **Answered (2026-10-08): linear overhead**,
   the strongest form possible (§2.7) — Thm 3.2 lands at the book's
   `f(n+1) = o(g(n))`.

## 8. Decision log

| Decision | Status |
|---|---|
| Chapters 3-4 run as one campaign on `complexity/arora-barak-ch3-4` (from `main` @ `99b187fc`), same methodology as Chapters 1-2; artifacts `ch3-*`/`ch4-*` | Proposed |
| Existing sorry-free Chapter-3/4 material on `main` (Hydroxyi, `f70c57c2`) is received and audited (P0), never duplicated | Proposed |
| Prior-art survey (2026-10-08): repository inventory (§1 tables); Bonnet lax-434930/362205/783278, cslib `ConfigBound`, Toruńczyk lax-218471 (§5) | Recorded |
| Chapter 4 machine work goes through program layers (`LogProg.ARM`, `CounterProg`, proposed extensions §2.5) | Proposed |
| §2 foundation choices and §7 provisional answers | **Answered 2026-10-08** (user): Q1 yes to both, Q2 extend in place co-owned, Q3 strengthen, Q5 CNF, Q6 Thm 3.2 mandatory / Ladner core-late, Q7 all branches halt. Q4 and Q8 open |
| Routine layer set up in parallel with the statement phases, scoped to **amply support the ch-1/2 retrofit** (full bank/relocation/dispatch/frame catalog), with space costs throughout; Hennie-Stearns + two-tape universal as first consumers; retrofit itself not a gate (§4a) | Decided (user, 2026-10-08) |
| §12 open decision 12.1 answered (user, 2026-10-08): R2 seam-composition space accounting takes the **sharper per-tape form** (max on disjointly-owned tapes) — sharpest available, for downstream applications | Decided |
| **P3.1 and P4.1 statement skeletons landed** (2026-10-08): `TuringMachine/{OracleFinite,OracleNondeterministic,NondeterministicSpace}.lean`, `ClassOracle/{Classes,SATOracle}.lean` + facade, `SpaceComplexity/{NSPACE,SpaceClasses,Constructible,Inclusions,Examples}.lean`; 24 sorried statements (10 oracle + 14 space), each with a policy-grade sketch; skeleton-time proofs: the `toFinOracleTM` bridge and the oracle `runWith` algebra (mirrors of proved infrastructure, flagged for the audits). All modules elaborate fresh (zero errors); style lint 0 FAIL; `Ex 4.7`'s `MULT` deferred to P4.4 (encoding conventions), the ARM extension interfaces deferred to the §12 gate + colleague sync. Audit packs for P3.1/P4.1 follow once P0's round returns | Recorded |
| **§12 statement skeleton landed** (2026-10-08, sub-agent drafted, maintainer-reviewed line by line): `Build/Embed.lean` (R1, two transformers over a shared core per 12.4, 9 sorried), `Build/Seam.lean` (R2, dispatch constant exactly 1, per-tape visited-set containment headline per 12.1, 6 sorried), `Build/Catalog.lean` (R3, five seam routines defined + W1-W3/L and P1-P15 space rows, 32 sorried; `Primitives.lean` byte-identical per 12.2a). Review: machine semantics traced phase by phase; restated time clauses spot-checked **verbatim** against `computesFunInTime_id`/`_prepend`/`_cond`/`exists_loopTM`; scope clarification: stream rows P16-P18 ride with the emitter-lazy scope (flagged to the gate). All modules elaborate, 0 errors; its statement-gate pack is next | Recorded |
| **P3.2 statement skeleton landed** (2026-10-08, sub-agent drafted, maintainer-reviewed line by line): `TuringMachine/OracleAgreement.lean` (7 sorried) + `Diagonalization/{EXPCOM,Relativization,NotTimeConstructible}.lean` + facade (10 sorried) — 17 statements; EXPCOM per CH34-Q4, extrinsic-clock enumeration per [BGS75], Ex 3.5 non-trivialized. Review fixes: stage-construction sketch's decided-length bound corrected to `max nᵢ (budget)` (the `i = 0` edge). Five natural-home promotions flagged for the P3.1 gate close; all cited lemma names verified to exist. P3.1 files untouched (layout decision: all of P3.2 lives in `Diagonalization/`) | Recorded |
| **Two statement-gate packs out in parallel** (2026-10-08): `audits/routine-infra-{pack,bundle}.md` (the §12 layer: 47 statements; bundle sha256 `e9216b8b…`, 14 attachments incl. the byte-identical `Build/` context) and `audits/ch3-p32-{pack,bundle}.md` (P3.2: 17 statements; bundle sha256 `dbfadcfb…`, 22 attachments incl. the unaudited P3.1 surface with the layering caveat declared, [BGS75] scanned-original link supplied). Fresh per-pack sweeps with revisions recorded at start (0 errors; 47 and 17 sorry warnings exactly); both gates close on zero blockers/majors. Disjoint audit surfaces — concurrent repairs cannot collide with each other or with the P0/R2 surface | Recorded |
| **P0 reception gate CLOSED** (round 2, 2026-10-08, `audits/ch34-p0-r2-findings.md`: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 3 minors**; loop summary `audits/ch34-p0-resolutions.md`). The repair diff was reconstructed hash-exactly by the auditor; all ten S-statements independently derived true as stated; S9 admits the tighter `t·(2B+3)` (recorded for fill, statement unchanged). The three minors swept in the closing commit and re-verified: the `Reaches.toB` reference corrected (finding 6 residual), "machine-checked" wording honestied to "elaborated, proofs deferred" (finding 11), and the two timed zero-tape witness statements added to `ZeroSpace.lean` (finding 12; now 11 sorried there). Two pack errata acknowledged in the resolutions. The received 44-module surface is adopted; the P3.1 and P4.1 statement gates are unblocked | Recorded |
| **P3.1 and P4.1 statement-gate packs out** (2026-10-08, unblocked by the P0 closure): `audits/ch3-p31-{pack,bundle}.md` (10 statements + declared skeleton-time proofs; bundle sha256 `37d2fd94…`, 19 attachments; concurrent-P3.2 cross-filing note) and `audits/ch4-p41-{pack,bundle}.md` (14 statements; bundle sha256 `58bdb768…`, 22 attachments; sits on the P0-closed surface, inherits and declares the zero-bound collapse for `NSPACE`, seeds the `NSPACE` sanity-twin question and the `evenLang` zero-tape harmonization). Fresh per-pack sweeps with revisions at start: 0 errors, exactly 10 and 14 sorry warnings. **All four early statement phases are now under concurrent external audit** on pairwise-disjoint surfaces | Recorded |
| **P4.2 statement skeleton landed** (2026-10-08, maintainer-drafted): `SpaceComplexity/ConfigGraph.lean` (the vertex = core **plus a three-valued output summary** — the P0 fitness note's acceptance gap closed by design; `CfgStep`/reachability dictionary; ND Claim 4.4(1) in acceptance form; the packaged `DecidesInSpace` iff; Thm 4.2(iii) with the `2^(c·(S n + 1))` union rendering; `NL ⊆ P`; Ex 4.3 as nontrivial-NL-hardness, with the exercise's moral in the docstring) and `SpaceComplexity/Savitch.lean` (`spaceConstructible_poly` at degree ≥ 1 — degree 0 provably fails the bundled `logSpace ≤ S`; Savitch via the iterative frame stack, a §12 R1/R2 consumer; `PSPACE = NPSPACE`). 10 sorried statements, zero errors, lint 0 FAIL. **The P4.1-frozen facade is untouched**: both modules wired through the root import only, facade wiring deferred to the P4.1 gate close. Layering: builds on P4.1 (under audit) + P0-closed surface; its gate pack follows the P3.2-over-P3.1 declared-caveat pattern, after the P4.1 round returns | Recorded |
| **P4.3 statement skeleton landed** (2026-10-08, maintainer-drafted): `Formulas/{QBF,QBFEncoding}.lean` (prenex QBF with CNF matrix per CH34-Q5; free-variables-read-false totalization; true-fallback decode matching the `SAT` polarity; the Example-4.12 `SAT` embedding), `ClassPSPACE/{TQBF,Games}.lean` + facade (Def 4.9 over `≤ₚ`; the collapse corollary; **Claim 4.4(2) existentially packaged with two declared deviations** — `O(s+n)` one-hot-input codec for locality, polynomial rather than linear CNF size, both harmless to Thm 4.13; `TQBF` + both halves of Thm 4.13, hardness = the `ψᵢ`-emitter summit; Zermelo determinacy), `SpaceComplexity/Hierarchy.lean` (the space-universal machine with the `+ logSpace` clock addend declared against Ex 4.1's literal `Ct`; Thm 4.8 at **constant-factor** hypothesis strength — no square, no log, the space story's advantage over the received `f²` time hierarchy; `L ⊊ PSPACE`; Ex 3.2 at the `n+1` normalization with the `NP` `≤ₚ`-closure named as a derived obligation). 12 sorried statements, zero errors, lint 0 FAIL. Facade wiring: new `ClassPSPACE` facade + `Formulas` facade extended (closed-campaign, not frozen); `Hierarchy` root-wired since the `SpaceComplexity` facade stays P4.1-frozen. Its gate pack follows the layered-caveat pattern once P4.1/P4.2 rounds allow | Recorded |
| **P4.4 statement skeleton landed** (2026-10-08, maintainer-drafted) — **the chapter-4 statement program is complete**: `SpaceComplexity/Logspace/{Reductions,Path,ImmermanSzelepcsenyi,Mult}.lean`, 11 sorried statements. `≤ₗ` over the received implicit-logspace layer; **general Lemma 4.17 now stated** (`ImplicitlyLogspaceComputable.comp` — the composition the P0 round recorded as undelivered), with transitivity, the `L`-downward closure, the `≤ₚ` refinement, and the `NL = L` collapse corollary; the campaign's first graph encoding (`encodePATH`, EXPCOM-pattern existential membership) with `GraphReach` **in-house** (deviation from plan §2.6's `Digraph.Reachable` target: the GraphTheory tree carries admissions outside the audited closure; bridging lemma recorded as future work); `PATH ∈ NL` and Thm 4.18 (hardness via the P4.2 vertex layer, the accepting normalization discharging the P0 unique-terminal caveat; the reduction's bit queries assembled by the received `arm_decides`); Thm 4.20 both as `PATHᶜ ∈ NL` and `NL = coNL`, with **no read-once certificate model** — the binary-choice NDTM's choice words are natively read-once, a declared simplification; Cor 4.21 over the P4.2 configuration-graph layer; `MULT ∈ L` closing Ex 4.7. The nondeterministic ARM extension gains its first two named customers (the `PATH` walk, the counting verifier). Zero errors; lint 0 FAIL; root-wired (facade stays P4.1-frozen) | Recorded |
| **P3.1 gate CLOSED** (round 1, 2026-10-08: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 2 minors / 4 notes** — `audits/ch3-p31-findings.md` verbatim, loop summary `audits/ch3-p31-resolutions.md`). Minors swept in the closing commit: the Theorem-2.6 docstring equation regains its load-bearing `+1` (auditor-refuted, maintainer-verified against `NP_eq_iUnion_NTIME`), and the Ex 3.6(2) sketch carries the explicit query ledger at degree `k·(1+max 1 e)` with the extracted-prefix-only virtual-input obligation. The fixed-oracle clock split is confirmed sound, with the timeout-wrapper reconciliation carried to the P3.2 gate. Natural-home promotions stay deferred until P3.2 closes | Recorded |
| **P4.1 gate CLOSED** (round 1, 2026-10-08: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 5 minors / 4 notes** — `audits/ch4-p41-findings.md` verbatim, loop summary `audits/ch4-p41-resolutions.md`). Minors swept: both constructibility sketches corrected at `n = 0` (bits-length identity; counter initialized at `1`), the exact-space refutation claim retracted (time's argument does not transfer), the `evenLang` route kept direct (the pack's harmonization suggestion was cycle-inducing — pack erratum acknowledged, with the inventory undercount), SAT3 at delivered polynomial strength. Carried obligations: `NSPACE` sanity twins as a future additive layer; the short-prefix argument into the invariance fill; `NP ⊆ PSPACE`'s five host obligations and its hard §12 R1/R2/R3 dependency into the fill brief. **The `SpaceComplexity` facade is unfrozen and now carries the P4.2-P4.4 modules**; the P4.2 pack is unblocked | Recorded |
| **P4.3 landing erratum repaired** (2026-10-08): the `Formulas.lean` facade extension of 572304e5 appended its two QBF imports **after** the module docstring — invalid Lean. The landing sweep did not include the facade module, so the error went undetected, and the facade's sole dependent (the root `TCSlib.lean`) elaborated against the stale pre-P4.3 olean. Repaired in place (imports moved into the header block, `## Contents` rows added for `QBF`/`QBFEncoding`); the facade re-elaborates fresh, 0 errors (the root itself stays outside the campaign sweep surface — it imports non-campaign trees with no scratch oleans — so its exposure was import-order only). Sweep-hygiene consequence adopted: every gate sweep lists the touched facades explicitly | Recorded |
| **Three statement-gate packs out in parallel** (2026-10-08): `audits/ch4-p42-{pack,bundle}.md` (P4.2: 10 statements; bundle sha256 `5139d5ae…`, 24 attachments), `audits/ch4-p43-{pack,bundle}.md` (P4.3: 12 statements; bundle sha256 `5a52f398…`, 30 attachments, P4.2-unaudited layering caveat declared), `audits/ch4-p44-{pack,bundle}.md` (P4.4: 11 statements; bundle sha256 `899d3c43…`, 24 attachments, same caveat). All three audited at `200f4693`; fresh per-pack sweeps with revisions recorded at start (0 errors; 10/12/11 sorry warnings exactly); style lint re-scoped after assembly review caught the single-directory linter CLI (SpaceComplexity 42 + Formulas 5 + ClassPSPACE 2 files, 0 FAIL / 0 WARN). Review repairs applied before shipping (the P3.2 pattern, each disclosed in its pack): the QBF sketch's `eval_congr_of_lt_numVars` namespace (`0a1982a0`); `PSPACE_eq_NPSPACE`'s degree-0 routing off bare `NSPACE.mono` (fails pointwise at `n = 0`) and the splice-padding clause in `acceptsWithin_of_spaceUsedWith_le` (`200f4693`). Attachment manifests extended per the P4.1 erratum lesson (TEMPLATE, closed resolutions, `NTIME.lean`; P0 findings where quoted). Disjoint audit surfaces; **five rounds now live** (§12, P3.2, P4.2, P4.3, P4.4) — the chapter-3/4 statement program has every drafted phase under external audit | Recorded |
| **P3.3 statement skeleton landed** (2026-10-08, maintainer-drafted): `TuringMachine/NDCodes.lean` (the two-work-tape coded normal form `CodeNDTM` — two tapes because the [BGW70]-style guess-then-verify reduction is linear into two, not one — with `actionBits₂` serialization mirroring `CodeTM.serialize` record for record, the `NDMachineCode`/`EffectiveNDMachineCode` scheme laws, the skeleton-time `decode_encode` mirror, and the sorried scheme existence; 1 sorried) and `Diagonalization/NTimeHierarchy.lean` (the clocked universal NDTM at **linear overhead** per CH34-Q8 — iff-packaged with an unconditional fused clock, the book's timeout-accept polarity declared absorbed; the exponential deterministic acceptance evaluator; the linear coded-normal-form transfer with deliberately unbounded backward direction + the truncation note; **Thm 3.2 at book strength** with the extra `f n` domination addend declared (covers the inclusion half without monotonicity); the positive-bound form; the showcase `NTIME(n+1) ⊊ NTIME((n+1)²)` with the squared-overhead impossibility note; 6 sorried). 7 sorried total, 0 errors, lint 0 FAIL (Diagonalization 0 WARN; TuringMachine only the pre-existing size WARNs). **Root-wired**: the `Diagonalization.lean` facade is frozen under the live P3.2 gate and `TuringMachine.lean` is untouched — facade wiring at the respective closes (the P4.2 precedent). Gate pack after the relevant rounds return | Recorded |
| **P3.4 (Ladner) moved to backlog** (user, 2026-10-08): per CH34-Q6 core-late — `backlog.md` §2 entry with scope (`SAT_H`, Ex 3.6(a)/(b), the Claim, Thm 3.3, ~6 statements) and the trigger (draft when the live rounds settle; independent of P3.3's code layer). With P3.3 drafted, **every core phase of the chapter-3/4 statement program is drafted**; P3.4 is the sole remaining statement phase | Recorded |
| **P4.2 gate CLOSED** (round 1, 2026-10-08: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 5 minors / 3 notes** — `audits/ch4-p42-findings.md` verbatim, loop summary `audits/ch4-p42-resolutions.md`). Minors swept: the splice sketch's sibling-halting assertion dropped (the statement has no such hypothesis — the accepting branch alone pads, auditor counterexample confirmed), Exercise 4.3's printed "complete" recorded as a **textbook erratum** (hardness only; completeness needs `L ∈ NL`), the received count cited as `Turing.FinTM.configBound`, `LOGSPACE_subset_P` described as count-arithmetic precedent rather than "the same search", the `+ 1` described as normalization (the `c = 0` exponent is `0`). Carried: the carrier-bridge obligations (quotient lifting, outside-window rejection, reflexive base), the resource ledgers (constructor time through the received count theorem, fixed-interval frame reuse, exact `(n^c+1).bits` output), and the pack's question-3 sibling erratum acknowledged | Recorded |
| **P4.4 gate CLOSED** (round 1, 2026-10-08: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 2 minors / 5 notes** — `audits/ch4-p44-findings.md` verbatim, loop summary `audits/ch4-p44-resolutions.md`). Minors swept, both in `mem_LOGSPACE_of_logspaceReducible`'s sketch: the characteristic function's length language is **exactly** `{pairEncode x []}` (regular, not total), and the index-`0` step is a **paired-input** specialization on `dbl x ++ [false, true]`, proved directly (no circularity). Note-4 accuracy edit: the P0 unique-terminal caveat is *assigned* to `PATH_NLComplete`'s fill, not already closed (`cleanTM` does not reset the input head). Carried: the `comp` query ledger, the counting-verifier disciplines (ascending order, exact counts, direction-sensitive negative test), `mem_NL_of_logspaceReducible` as a future additive statement | Recorded |
| **P4.3 round 1: FAIL — gate open** (2026-10-08: **1 blocker / 4 majors / 4 minors / 3 notes** — `audits/ch4-p43-findings.md` verbatim). The blocker: `exists_adjacency_codec_cnf` was **false as stated** — fixed-length injective codes on *full* configurations are impossible, the output tape being unbounded (the auditor's pigeonhole at `n = s = 0`). **Repairs landed same day**: the codec restated over the quotient carrier (input + `Turing.NDTM.coreSum`) with the new `Turing.Cfg.InWindow`, in-package validity/adjacency/acceptance CNFs (the junk-midpoint guard), serialized-length size bounds (the empty-clause gap), and cross-input rejection; the hardness sketch rebuilt (`Valid`-guarded ψ with the `a = b ∨ Next` base, Tseitin-after-prefix, the **uniform emitter declared a private fill obligation** — the existential is not an algorithm); `space_universal`'s sketch now tests visited-interval **cardinality** with probe-then-replay output; `space_hierarchy`'s sketch now uses the **capped increasing-budget loop** with one fixed padded code and names the space-preserving normal form; membership validates the whole encoding before any verdict; `Games.determined`'s value fixed to the player-one perspective; the padding sketch concretized. Re-audit round per `workflow.md` §3; pack `audits/ch4-p43-r2-pack.md` | Recorded |
| **P4.3 round-2 pack out** (2026-10-08): `audits/ch4-p43-r2-{pack,bundle}.md` — re-audit of the round-1 repairs at `aa02db41`, per-finding disposition table, the complete repair diff attached (`audits/evidence/ch4-p43-r2-repairs.diff`: one statement restated, one definition added, six sketches + one docstring bullet rewritten; every other declaration byte-identical). Bundle sha256 `beb69f18…`, 32 attachments (round-1 findings verbatim, the closed P4.2 resolutions as the updated layering context, fresh r2 sweep 12/0 and lint 0 FAIL over 5+2+42 files). Gate closes on zero blockers/majors | Recorded |
| **P3.3 statement-gate pack out** (2026-10-08): `audits/ch3-p33-{pack,bundle}.md` — 7 statements (NDCodes 1, NTimeHierarchy 6), 7 definitions, one declared skeleton-time proof (`NDMachineCode.decode_encode`, mirror of proved infrastructure). Audited at `a664c3e4`, files byte-identical to landing `72718693`; fresh sweep 7/0, lint 0 FAIL (Diagonalization 0 WARN over 4 files; TuringMachine the 8 pre-existing size WARNs over 39). **Closed-surfaces-only layering** — no sorried concurrent statement is consumed; §12 cited as fill engine only; root-wired (Diagonalization facade frozen under live P3.2, TuringMachine facade untouched). Ten declared deviations incl. the two-work-tape normal form, the iff-packaged unconditional clock, the fused linear clock vs `timed_universal`'s `C·(t+1)²`, the unbounded backward transfer, the `f n` domination addend, and the no-`|x|` budgets. Bundle sha256 `45339e25…`, 23 attachments (incl. `Universal.lean` and `MathlibBridge.lean` as mirror/contrast context, per the P4.1 erratum lesson). Gate closes on zero blockers/majors | Recorded |
| **Four rounds returned, all FAIL** (2026-10-08/09, findings verbatim in `audits/{routine-infra,ch3-p32,ch4-p43-r2,ch3-p33}-findings.md`): **§12** 0 blockers / 4 majors (R1 the closed embeddings cannot express the halt-to-live return — the final emission is lost either way, formal trace supplied; R2 seam composition exports canonical-endpoint theorems only, cannot consume arbitrary frames or output-carrying seams; R3 the first-return cut excludes positive entry-equals-exit calls — a fresh-entry/release adapter is needed; R4 `pairMapSnd`'s documented witness is refuted — the capture tape visits output-length cells, a forwarding controller is commissioned); **P3.2** 1 blocker (`EXPCOM` over the arbitrary `TimeHierarchy.code`: `EffectiveMachineCode` bounds no decoding time, and a tagged scheme embeds an arbitrarily hard decidable language into decoding — statements 9-12 unprovable as stated; the locality layer, stage construction, and the BGS existential all survive); **P4.3 r2** 1 blocker (the serialized-size bound `C·(s+n+1)^C` is self-contradictory at `n = s = 0`: the code width equals `C` while one literal reading the second block already serializes to `C + 6`; all four round-1 majors otherwise resolved); **P3.3** 0 blockers / 2 majors (both in `ntime_hierarchy`'s sketch: the per-code universal constant cannot be absorbed by padded-index choice — padding preserves `decode` but no law preserves cost — and the ladder locator as sketched is not computable within the allowance). No headline theorem refuted anywhere; every verdict names its repair route. Repairs follow per phase | Recorded |
| **Four repair batches landed and four re-audit packs out** (2026-10-09, audited at `9a92fa1a`): **§12 r2** — the returning embeddings `embedSilentRetTM`/`embedEmitRetTM` (halt-to-live through-halt contracts), the general-configuration seam theorems (`seamCompTM_run_ofCfg` + first-return + visited), the `seamReleaseTM` fresh-entry adapter, the forwarding `pairMapSnd` controller, three minor sketch repairs; 47 → **56 sorried** (`audits/routine-infra-r2-{pack,bundle}.md`, sha256 `fc7afcb8…`, 20 attachments); `Build/Catalog.lean` crosses 1000 lines — justified by the queued per-theme split (backlog §2, decision 12.2c). **P3.2 r2** — `Turing.UniformMachineCode` (bounded-acceptance simulator at one polynomial in code+input+deadline jointly), sorried existence, `EXPCOM` redefined over the chosen scheme (choice-over-sorried-existence declared); 17 → **18 sorried** (`audits/ch3-p32-r2-{pack,bundle}.md`, sha256 `9de1defa…`, 24 attachments, `Universal`/`MathlibBridge`/`CodeParser` attached per the round-1 request). **P4.3 r3** — serialized-size bounds to base `s+n+2`, the quotient clause an iff, five wordings; r2-pack "equal codes required" erratum acknowledged (`audits/ch4-p43-r3-{pack,bundle}.md`, sha256 `6a04a9cc…`, 33 attachments). **P3.3 r2** — the hierarchy sketch rebuilt (fixed-code schedule `pair(j,r)`, `f`-adaptive tower ladder with capped-comparison locating, self-clocked interpreter at uniform `K·(g n + 1)`, both transfer instantiations), six sketch corrections; round-1 pack's `g 0 = 0` claim acknowledged as erratum (`audits/ch3-p33-r2-{pack,bundle}.md`, sha256 `fedeadf8…`, 25 attachments). Fresh sweeps 56/18/12/7 with 0 errors at `9a92fa1a`; combined lint 0 FAIL. Four rounds live again | Recorded |
| **P4.3 gate CLOSED** (round 3, 2026-10-09: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 0 minors / 2 notes** — `audits/ch4-p43-r3-findings.md` verbatim; loop summary `audits/ch4-p43-resolutions.md`, the campaign's first three-round statement loop). The amended `s+n+2` base verified with one shared constant uniformly; the factorization iff and all five wordings accepted; no sweeps. Carried: the uniform-emitter family and the quotient path lift as private hardness-fill obligations; the probe-then-replay universal and capped increasing-budget hierarchy disciplines. **Chapter 4 fully closed at the statement level** | Recorded |
| **§12 round 2: FAIL — repaired, round-3 pack out** (2026-10-09: **1 blocker / 0 majors / 0 minors / 1 note** — `audits/routine-infra-r2-findings.md` verbatim; the seven other new contracts and all round-1 dispositions accepted, S7/S8/S9 replayed successfully). The blocker: both through-halt contracts were false at `T = 0` for an initially halted configuration (the handover projection demands `none = some (Sum.inr ())`). Repair at `2b82cbb3`: `(hc : c.state ≠ none)` on both — equivalent to `0 < T` under the first-halt hypothesis — with the counterexample recorded in the docstring. The round-2 pack's 6+3 inventory subdivision acknowledged as an erratum (5 run/first-return + 4 visited-set). Round-3 pack `audits/routine-infra-r3-{pack,bundle}.md` (bundle sha256 `bb651440…`, 21 attachments, the 38-line diff attached); fresh sweep 56/0, lint 0 FAIL. **The §12 round is the campaign's last open statement gate** | Recorded |
| **§12 gate CLOSED** (round 3, 2026-10-09: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 1 minor / 0 notes** — `audits/routine-infra-r3-findings.md` verbatim; loop summary `audits/routine-infra-resolutions.md`, a three-round loop). The round-2 counterexample verified excluded, the full positive-time through-halt induction supplied, consumers discharge `hc` at every live seam, byte-identity confirmed to blob hashes. Minor swept: the `hc ↔ 0 < T` equivalence stated under **both** first-halt hypotheses (forward `hhalt`, reverse `hlive 0`); two pack errata acknowledged in the resolutions. **Facade wiring**: `Build/{Embed,Seam,Catalog}.lean` join `TuringMachine.lean`, root temporary imports removed. **EVERY STATEMENT GATE OF THE CAMPAIGN IS NOW CLOSED** (P0, P3.1-P3.3, P4.1-P4.4, §12); remaining statement work: P3.4 (Ladner, backlog); next: fill epochs | Recorded |
| **Post-statement-program roadmap and §12 fill partition recorded** (user-directed, 2026-10-09): new plan sections **§4b** (the six remaining stages: fill prerequisites — §12 fill, ARM extensions with the colleague sync, Hennie-Stearns + two-tape universal; the fill epochs on the §6 summit order; P3.4 on hold; the ch1-2 retrofit alongside; closure; one PR per chapter) and **§4c** (the routine-layer fill partition: **epoch F1**, 3 parallel disjoint-file batches — F1A Embed 13, F1B Seam 11 general-trio-first, F1C Catalog Part 1 + W1/W2 13 — then **epoch F2**, F2A the 19 Part-2 space rows risk-ordered with the `pairMapSnd` forwarding controller as summit; audit at each epoch boundary; briefs embed the audit-inherited proof plans verbatim). P3.4 explicitly held (user, 2026-10-09) | Recorded |
| **Epoch-F1 briefs issued** (2026-10-09): `briefs/routine-f1-batch{A,B,C}.md` per the §4c partition — A: `Build/Embed.lean`, 13 targets, the round-3 through-halt induction embedded verbatim as the binding plan; B: `Build/Seam.lean`, 11 targets, general-configuration trio first with the round-2 lockstep identities and the `ofWords`/`mapState` substitution embedded; C: `Build/Catalog.lean` Part 1 + W1/W2, 13 targets, the round-1 exact movement-count table embedded with the slack/trajectory clarifications, the 19 epoch-F2 rows explicitly frozen-in-place (final sweep must show exactly 19 sorry warnings). All three: hardened repo/branch headers (issued at `f7f4f0f7`), zip delivery, D1 axiom wording (at-most-triple, no `sorryAx`), continuation-budget clauses. Batches dispatched by the maintainer in parallel chats | Recorded |
| **Epoch F1 integrated** (2026-10-09): all three batches returned complete and verified — A 13/13 (`Build/Embed.lean` now zero-sorry; 14 private additions incl. the `embedThroughHalt` core), B 11/11 (`Build/Seam.lean` zero-sorry; general cores with canonical instances, 13 privates), C 13/13 (`Build/Catalog.lean` Part 1 + W1/W2; **exactly 19 F2 sorries remain, byte-identical**; the `catalogTrace` full-configuration traces). Maintainer verification: SHA256SUMS 15/12/14 OK; each patch touches only its owned file; mechanical freeze audit — every removed line a `sorry` body plus two flagged Fill appendices in A; fresh replay sweep 0 errors (`audits/logs/routine-f1-integration-sweep.log`); **37/37 independent axiom prints** at most the standard triple, zero `sorryAx` (`audits/logs/routine-f1-axioms.log`); lint 0 FAIL. Integration by `git am -3`, Codex authorship preserved (d20ab758, a5012741, 2f67e910). Agent reports archived under `audits/routine-f1-agent-reports/`; patches under `audits/evidence/`. Deliveries also contained environment-shim C files (LD_PRELOAD `/proc/self/exe` workarounds per their reports) — **excluded per the standing instruction**: not compiled, not run, not integrated, unreferenced by the patches. C's requested shared lemma (a public `redirectTM` head-trajectory projection) recorded for the natural-home queue. The F1 epoch-boundary audit pack follows | Recorded |
| **Epoch-F1 fill-gate pack out** (2026-10-09): `audits/routine-f1-{pack,bundle}.md` — the epoch audit over the 37 kernel-checked fills: blind restatement of the sixty new private declarations (A 14, B 13, C 33), contract fidelity against the binding inherited plans, the declared anomalies (A's two unused-`hcap` warnings on frozen signatures; the two Fill appendices; C's shared-lemma request; the excluded environment-shim C files), and drift verification against the attached patch series. Bundle sha256 `b610b75e…`, 22 attachments (the three agent reports and patches verbatim, the maintainer's independent sweep/axiom/lint logs). Gate closes on zero blockers/majors; epoch F2 dispatches at its close | Recorded |
| **Epoch F1 gate CLOSED** (round 1, 2026-10-09: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 1 minor / 4 notes** — `audits/routine-f1-findings.md` verbatim; loop summary `audits/routine-f1-resolutions.md`). All sixty new private declarations blind-restated clean; contract fidelity verified; the freeze re-established independently down to reconstructed blobs. Minor swept: the plan §4c F1B row's "four canonical statements" → three (3+3+2+1+2 = 11). Dispositions: the unused-`hcap` premise **retained** (it carries the capture interpretation); both Fill appendices verified append-only; the public `redirectTM` head-trajectory projection queued for `Wrappers.lean` (the seven local copies collapse then); the shim exclusion confirmed at source level (no FFI/foreign/unsafe/native anywhere). **§12 is 37/56; Embed and Seam are complete zero-sorry files** | Recorded |
| **Epoch-F2 brief issued** (2026-10-09): `briefs/routine-f2-batchA.md` — the final 19 Catalog space rows in the §4c risk order ((i) constant-witness ×7, (ii) linear ×3, (iii) the R5 case-split pair, (iv) four constructions incl. the direct `lengthBits` counter, (v) `cond` + the loop row with the answer-5 ledger embedded verbatim, (vi) **the `pairMapSnd` forwarding controller last — the fill's only new machine**, the R4 ledger embedded). F1C's in-file private helpers declared available; the queued `Wrappers.lean` projection explicitly off-limits; delivery completes `Catalog.lean` to zero-sorry | Recorded |
| **F2A partial integrated; continuation A2 issued** (2026-10-09): batch F2A delivered **17/19** in the prescribed risk order under ground rule 7, frontier exactly the loop ledger and the `pairMapSnd` summit (both original sorries untouched; no admitted helpers — 306 new privates all proved, incl. the reopened local copies `f2_loopHost*`/`catalog_redirect*`). Maintainer verification: checksums 14/14; single-file patch; **freeze verified by direct content comparison** — all 72 original declarations verbatim and in order (the diff's non-sorry removals were Myers-pairing artifacts of the large insertions); replay 0 errors, exactly 2 sorries; independent axiom prints 18 clean + `sorryAx` on exactly the two frontier rows (`audits/logs/routine-f2a-{integration-sweep,axioms,stylelint}.log`). Integrated `git am -3` (64f02699, Codex authorship). The delivery's environment-shim C file again excluded, unreferenced. `Catalog.lean` now 9,404 lines (reopened private witnesses; split stays queued, 12.2c). **Continuation brief `briefs/routine-f2-batchA2.md` issued** (the B2 precedent): the two targets with the F2A frontier text, the answer-5 ledger, and the R4 controller obligations binding | Recorded |
| **Construction-reuse policy adopted** (user-directed, 2026-10-09): new `policy.md` §1 paragraph — machines come from the verified construction layers (`Build/` combinators + catalog with `machine-library-design.md` as the registry, and the program layers); existing routines are cited, never re-derived; near-misses are commissioned into the shared layer (private copy + requested promotion), never privately re-derived a third time; hand-built machines need a recorded reason naming the gap; the discipline extends to circuits when the gadget layer exists. On the campaign branch as `811e95c8`; **merged to `main` via PR #7** (the PR #6 single-file precedent); `policy.md` identical on both branches | Recorded |
| **A2 integrated — §12 routine layer COMPLETE, 56/56 proved** (2026-10-09): continuation batch A2 delivered **2/2** — the loop ledger (`exists_loopTM_spaceUsed`: common radius `S n + 4ℓ + 8`, `c = c₀ + 19k`, **no round-count multiplication**, per the binding answer-5 six-step ledger) and the commissioned forwarding controller (`computesFunInTime_pairMapSnd_spaceUsed`: new `a2_mapTM` witness — buffer/validate, emit `pairEncode a []`, simulate with virtual input incl. both boundary clamps and empty `b`; **coefficient one on `Sg`**, `A=22`, `B=5`, single `c=22`; the refuted `pairMapTM` capture witness nowhere used). 45 new privates, all proved, inventory matched head-for-head. Maintainer verification: checksums 20/20; both patches touch only `Catalog.lean`; **freeze by direct content** — exactly two removed lines (both `sorry` bodies), all 378 base declaration heads verbatim and in order; `git am -3` (97daf8a5, 47880f58, Codex authorship), delivered source byte-identical; replay **0 errors, 0 sorry warnings** on Catalog + facade; **20/20 independent axiom prints** exactly the standard triple, no `sorryAx` (`audits/logs/routine-f2a2-{integration-sweep,axioms,stylelint}.log`); lint 0 FAIL (Catalog 10,876 lines — split stays queued, 12.2c). The delivery's environment-shim C file again **excluded per the standing instruction**, unreferenced by the patches. The F2 epoch-boundary audit pack follows | Recorded |
| **Epoch F2 gate CLOSED — §12 fill campaign COMPLETE** (round 1, 2026-10-09: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 1 minor / 6 no-findings rows** — `audits/routine-f2-findings.md` verbatim; loop summary `audits/routine-f2-resolutions.md`). The auditor independently recomputed the bundle hash, reconstructed all three source states by bidirectional patch replay (blobs `b239b408…`/`f4b449b2…`/`798fb8ac…`), re-established both freezes, re-enumerated the 306+45 inventory, blind-restated all 45 A2 privates individually + the F2A load-bearers over a 30-family partition, verified the answer-5 and R4 ledgers (joint `S+T+1` coefficient, no round-count space factor; coefficient-one `Sg`, both empty-`b` clamps, no output buffer, `pairMapTM` absent), audited all six `f2_space_of_time` call sites, and ran fourteen adversarial instantiations. Minor F2-1 **swept at close** (prose only): the `f2_loopHost_start` sketch's "no-anchor prefix includes time zero" now qualified — zero-time startup already occupies the anchor (vacuous premise) and takes the two administrative steps directly; post-sweep fresh sweep clean (`audits/logs/routine-f2-close-sweep.log`). Carried: copy provenance of the unattached Loop/Primitives reopenings audited on merits (Wrappers copies verified literal); optional regression corollaries (zero-startup, both virtual clamps, emitting-halt seam) noted for the 12.2c refactor, not required. **The routine layer stands 56/56 proved — statement gate (3 rounds) + F1 (round 1) + F2 (round 1); §4b stage 2 (ARM extensions + colleague sync) is unblocked** | Recorded |
| **ARM extensions + colleague sync moved to backlog §2** (user, 2026-10-09; outreach to Hydroxyi initiated the same day). The §2.5 extensions wait on their reply and leave the backlog by a decision row here. They **block fills only, never statements** (the machine-heavy P4.x fills — `PATH ∈ NL`, Immerman-Szelepcsényi, Cor 4.21 on the ND ARM; `TQBF ∈ PSPACE`, `NP ⊆ PSPACE`, polynomial Savitch on the wide ARM — plus the ARM interface statements deferred out of P4.1). Stage 1's remaining prerequisite is Hennie-Stearns + the two-work-tape universal | Decided |
| **Tracks A and B opened in parallel** (user, 2026-10-09): **A** — the zone/virtual-input layer, `machine-library-design.md` **§13 drafted for review** (Z1 virtual-input hosting promoting the four-times-rebuilt `a2_mapVirtual` pattern; Z2 zoned carrier + shift rows for Hennie-Stearns, `SingleTape`/`ObliviousSetup` as harvest precedents; Z3 deterministic two-work-tape codes over the `actionBits₂` record; Z4 additive Robustness space annotation = the §2.7 Ex 4.1 fallback, with the design-time check of the universal's space bonus recorded as an obligation; open decisions 13.1-13.4). **B** — the chapter-1/2 retrofit under a **strict-simplification bar**: kernel-derived private inventories of `Build/Primitives`, `Build/Loop`, `CookLevin/Hardness` commissioned (classification REPLACE-R1/R2/CATALOG vs KEEP vs DEAD); the **`Universal*` cluster is excluded** (two-tape-universal pilot territory); partition §4d to follow from the inventories. **Retrofit integration rule (user, binding)**: retrofit batch output is never pushed to the campaign branch directly — integrate on a side branch, open a PR into `complexity/arora-barak-ch3-4`, the user merges manually. 12.2c stays queued post-retrofit | Decided |
| **P3.2 gate CLOSED** (round 2, 2026-10-09: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 2 minors / 1 note** — `audits/ch3-p32-r2-findings.md` verbatim; loop summary `audits/ch3-p32-resolutions.md`). Both round-1 counterconstructions verified to violate the new `UniformMachineCode` clauses; `exists_uniformMachineCode` confirmed true by the auditor's independent polynomial construction over the concrete grammar (adopted into the sketch — minor R2-1: the received compiler route is arbitrary-time, no received polynomial ledger is claimed); "four-coordinate pairing" wording (R2-2). Carried: the fill-gate axiom-closure check for the choice-over-sorried-existence chain. **Natural-home promotions into the P3.1 files unblocked** | Recorded |
| **P3.3 gate CLOSED** (round 2, 2026-10-09: **PASS, 0 blockers / 0 majors / 2 minors / 2 notes** — `audits/ch3-p33-r2-findings.md` verbatim; loop summary `audits/ch3-p33-resolutions.md`). Both round-1 majors closed (fixed-code repetition; the concrete O(n) capped locator, no monotonicity needed). Minors swept: the ladder pinned (`ℓ₀ := 2` seed, the source formula authoritative — round-2 pack paraphrase acknowledged as an offset erratum) and the clock-allowance split stated with the interpreter prefix-bound obligation; the stage-bottom comparison attributed to the square (note 3). **Facade rewiring**: `NDCodes` joins `TuringMachine.lean`, `NTimeHierarchy` joins `Diagonalization.lean` (P3.2+P3.3 both closed), the root's two temporary imports removed; `Robustness/Bidirectional` added to the scratch tree (facade sweep gap). **Every drafted phase of the chapter-3/4 statement program is now gated closed except the §12 routine layer**; P3.4 (Ladner) remains the sole undrafted phase | Recorded |
| CH34-Q4 answered (user, 2026-10-08): **EXPCOM route** for the `A` half of Thm 3.7 — Ex 3.6(3) promoted to core, the `NP^EXPCOM ⊆ EXP` simulator added to the summit list (continuation budget certain); [BGS75, Thm 1]'s self-referential oracle recorded as fallback | Decided |
| **P0 reception audit, round 1** (2026-10-08, `audits/ch34-p0-findings.md`, verbatim): **0 blockers, 1 major, 7 minors, 2 notes — gate does not close**; repairs + re-audit round per `workflow.md` §3. The auditor confirmed the time-hierarchy family, `configBound`, `LOGSPACE_subset_P`, the compiler contracts and the index encoding under their actual hypotheses | Recorded |
| **Round-1 major repaired** (finding 1, maintainer-verified: `visitedByTapeHead` images a nonempty range, so `k ≤ spaceUsed` always; one zero of `s` collapses `SPACE s` to the zero-work-tape class): positive-bound convention adopted (§2.4), Ex 3.2 restated at `SPACE(n+1)`, documented in `SpaceComplexity/Basic.lean`, sanity layer `SpaceComplexity/ZeroSpace.lean` added (S1-S6, sorried statements). Minors swept: `sim_run` headline + S9 statement (`sim_run_of_regs_le`), `Mode`/`callSegs` zero-argument qualifier, `valP`/`valQ` canonical payloads, `lenEq`/`lenLe` totalization note, `ReachesB` strict-endpoint wording, `ARMSim`/`Compile`/`Layout` export-list corrections; finding 7 (sweep-log provenance) repaired by a fresh sweep whose log records its revision at start. Notes 9-10 require no change | Recorded |
| CH34-Q8 answered (user, 2026-10-08): the universal NDTM is built at **linear overhead** (guess-then-verify), so Thm 3.2 lands at book strength `f(n+1) = o(g(n))` | Decided |
| CH34-Q4 research (2026-10-08): the machine-light oracle `A = K(A)` **is** [BGS75]'s own Theorem 1 (verified against the scanned original, pp. 433-434), so no deviation from the primary source; [AB09]'s `EXPCOM` is the substitution. Awaiting maintainer confirmation of the route | Recorded |
| Citation audit (2026-10-08), prompted by the maintainer: no missing code-inspiration citation found in campaign-authored Lean code — vendored cslib files carry full headers (pin `a3747758`), `Composition.lean` cites [Balbach22], `Build/*` + `machine-library-design.md` §1-11 were frozen 2026-10-03, two days **before** the first Bonnet examination (2026-10-05, scratchpad-only, never imported; backlog records the after-the-fact cost comparison as convergence). No brief ever carried external code. Hydroxyi's `TimeHierarchy//SpaceComplexity//PolyHierarchy/` trees cite only [AB09]; two design similarities flagged to *ask* (not assertions): `LogProg` compiler vs lax-434930's `TimeCompiler`; `ConfigCount.core` vs cslib `ConfigBound`'s `Cfg.core` (upstream 2026-09-14). §12 citation duty ([lax-434930], Apache-2.0) remains binding when that design is written | Recorded |

# TCSlib Contribution Policy

Standards for all Lean contributions to this repository, whether written by humans or by
agents. This document covers three things: **modularity** (how code is organized),
**attribution** (how every result is traced to a source), and **proof sketches** (how every
formal proof is accompanied by readable mathematics).

It complements, and does not replace:

- `workflow.md` — the campaign formalization process (phases, audit gates, fill epochs)
  that produces code meeting these standards.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — build workflows, import rules, CI integration points.
- `AGENTS.md` / `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — the sorry-ladder proof workflow and agent roster.
- `blueprint/BLUEPRINT_PIPELINE.md` — how blueprint entries are generated and validated.

Where this document names an existing mechanism (blueprint macros, hygiene scripts), the
policy is to *use that mechanism*, not to invent a parallel one.

## 1. Modularity

**Layout.** Content lives at `TCSlib/<Area>/<Topic>/<Piece>.lean`, one coherent concept or
lemma cluster per file, with a facade file `TCSlib/<Area>/<Topic>.lean` that imports every
child and carries a `/-! -/` module docstring with a `## Contents` list (one line per child).
See `TCSlib/Complexity/NPReductions.lean` for the reference example.

**File size.** Target 150–600 lines per math file. A file approaching 1000 lines should be
split unless there is a positive reason not to (e.g. a single long proof that cannot be
usefully decomposed).

**Exports.** Every new topic facade must be imported from `TCSlib.lean`. CI only builds what
is reachable from `TCSlib.lean`; an unexported file is invisible to CI, docs, and the
blueprint.

**Imports.** Precise module imports only. A bare `import Mathlib` fails CI. Import only what
the file uses.

**Namespaces.** Namespaces are area-local: pick one namespace root per topic and use it
consistently within that topic. Do not leak auxiliary definitions into the root namespace;
mark internal helpers `private` or put them in a dedicated inner namespace.
*Model registry exception*: a model-defining **type** (a machine, circuit, formula, or
decision-tree model) may live at the root namespace, Mathlib-style, provided it is
registered in the catalog facade `TCSlib/ComputationalModels.lean`; its operations and
lemmas still live in the type's own namespace. Anything else at root is a leak.

**Layering.** Keep definition files separate from heavyweight theorem files, so that
downstream work can import a model or a class definition without pulling in every proof about
it. When a development has both a "raw/general" layer and a "bundled" layer (e.g. a machine
model that is parametric in its types, plus a bundled version carrying finiteness instances),
headline definitions and theorems are stated against the bundled layer; the raw layer is
internal plumbing.

**Helpers.** Foundational helper lemmas that serve a whole area belong in that area's
`Basic.lean`, not in the file that first needed them.

**Construction reuse.** Machines are built from the verified construction layers, not from
scratch: the combinators and routine catalog of `TCSlib/Complexity/TuringMachine/Build/`
(conventions, wrappers, loops, primitives, embeddings, seams, and the catalog rows —
`machine-library-design.md` is the registry), and the program layers (`LogProg.ARM`,
`CounterProg`) where a register-level description suffices. Before writing a transition
table by hand, check the registry; a routine that exists is cited, not re-derived. A routine
that *almost* exists is the interesting case: do not write a third private variant — either
consume the general form, or commission the missing form into the shared layer (during a
fill batch: a `private` local copy plus a "requested shared lemma" in the report, promoted
at the next shared-file window). A hand-built machine is acceptable only when no layer
covers the need, and its docstring must say so and name what was missing — that sentence is
what turns the gap into the next catalog row. The chapter-1/2 files that predate this layer
re-derived the same bank/relocation/dispatch/frame families four times over (`emitterBank*`,
`clBank*`, `clSlot*`, …); the retrofit paying that debt back is the standing cautionary
tale. The same discipline applies to circuit construction once `CircuitComplexity`'s gadget
layer exists: gadgets, wiring combinators, and size/depth ledgers get one shared home and a
registry, and new circuits are assembled from it.

**Duplication.** Some duplication is mechanically forced by the campaign discipline —
exclusive file ownership, the statement freeze, and `private` visibility leave a fill batch
no other legal way to use another file's unexported machinery — and occasionally it is the
right engineering call. It is never silently acceptable: **every instance of duplicated
proved material must be human-approved.** A fill batch discloses each copy in its report;
the maintainer's integration ledger totals copied material per file (`workflow.md` §4); and
the audit template treats accumulated duplication as a major finding that a gate cannot
close over without the human maintainer explicitly accepting the debt and naming where and
when it is paid back (the registry's dedup/refactor queue). Duplication that was never
disclosed is a freeze violation, not debt.

**File header.** Every math file begins with the Mathlib-style copyright block, its imports,
the repo-standard options

```
set_option maxHeartbeats 0
set_option relaxedAutoImplicit false
set_option autoImplicit false
```

then a module docstring containing `# Title`, `## Main definitions`, `## Main results`, and
`## References` (see §2).

## 2. Attribution

Every mathematical statement in the library must be traceable to a source, at the level of
precision of a textbook theorem number or a paper section.

**File-level.** Every math file's module docstring contains a `## References` section giving
full citations with short tags, e.g.

```
## References

* [AB09] S. Arora, B. Barak, *Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach*,
  Cambridge University Press, 2009.
```

**Declaration-level.** Every definition, theorem, and lemma that corresponds to a result in
a source carries the tag with a precise location in its docstring: `[AB09, Claim 1.6]`,
`[AB09, §1.7]`, `[GRS25, Thm 4.2.1]`. Purely technical glue lemmas with no textbook
counterpart may omit the tag; anything a reader would recognize as "a result" may not.

**Deviations.** If the formal statement deviates from the source — different constants,
strengthened or weakened hypotheses, a reformulation — the docstring must say so and briefly
say why (e.g. "stated with explicit constant 5k rather than O(·), following the proof").

**Statement prose.** Every public declaration's docstring begins with a natural-language
statement of what it asserts (for a definition: what it is), precise enough that a reader
could judge the formalization's fidelity without parsing the Lean. The `[Tag, location]`
citation and any deviation note attach to that statement; the proof sketch (§3) follows it.
A bare label ("Unfolding lemma", "Helper for X") is not a statement. Instances are exempt,
as are vendored files (which follow upstream style). `private` declarations should carry
docstrings too, but at reviewer discretion rather than as a hard requirement. The blueprint
remains the cross-referenced informal layer for dependency structure (see **Blueprint**);
the docstring statement is what external audits compare blind restatements against, so it
is part of the trusted surface.

**Blueprint.** When an ingested reference exists under `blueprint/src/references/`, blueprint
entries use `\statementsource{<ref>}{<anchor>}` and `\proofsource{<ref>}{<anchor>}` to cite
it, subject to the existing rule that these are written only after an approved proofmatch
run. When starting a new chapter or paper, ingest it as a reference pair
(`<name>.raw.md` + `<name>.md`) so these citations are possible.

**Vendored code.** Lean code adapted from another project keeps the original copyright
header and license notice, and its file docstring names the source project, the commit it
was taken from, and a summary of local modifications.

**Design adaptation.** When a construction, proof architecture, or module design is
adapted from — or materially inspired by — another project's code, the debt is cited even
when no code is transcribed. The module docstring's `## References` section names the
source project, author, module or archive entry, the commit or version consulted, and its
license, with a short tag usable at declaration level; the precedent is
`TuringMachine/Composition.lean`'s `[Balbach22]` for the Isabelle AFP `Cook_Levin`
composition-combinator architecture. Design documents and blueprint entries built on the
adapted design carry the same citation. Examining external code purely for comparison,
with nothing taken, creates no citation duty, but on a campaign it belongs in the
campaign's records (plan decision log or backlog) so the provenance question is answerable
later. (Maintainer guideline, binding, 2026-10-06.)

## 3. Proof sketches

Every nontrivial formal proof is accompanied by a human-readable English proof sketch, kept
next to the Lean it describes.

**What counts as nontrivial.** Rule of thumb: any proof longer than ~20 lines of tactics, or
that would rate difficulty ≥ 3 on the blueprint scale. One-line `simp`/`omega`/`exact`
proofs need no sketch.

**Where sketches live.** In the Lean file itself:

- For most theorems: a `**Proof sketch.**` paragraph at the end of the theorem's docstring,
  written in mathematical English (not Lean identifiers), naming the key intermediate steps.
- For long proofs: additionally, short comments at the major `have`/section boundaries tying
  the tactics back to the sketch's steps.

The named intermediate steps of a sketch should be visible in the formalization as `have`s
or standalone lemmas — if the sketch says "first reduce to the one-tape case", there should
be a lemma that is that reduction.

**Where sketches do not live.** Not in the blueprint. Blueprint statement entries state
claims only; `scripts/dataset_hygiene.py --strict` hard-fails on proof content there. The
blueprint records *what* is true and its dependency structure; the Lean docstrings record
*why* it is true.

**Sketches and the sorry ladder.** When landing a sorry-skeleton, write the sketch at
skeleton time — the sketch *is* the plan, and each `sorry` should correspond to a named step
of it. A skeleton whose sketch cannot be written is not ready to land.

**Synchronization.** When a proof strategy changes, the sketch changes in the same commit.
A sketch that describes a proof the code no longer performs is worse than no sketch.

## Review checklist

Before merging new Lean content, check:

1. Files follow the Area/Topic layout with a facade, and `TCSlib.lean` exports are updated.
2. Imports are precise; no bare `import Mathlib`.
3. Every file has a `## References` section; every source-derived declaration has a
   `[Tag, location]` in its docstring; deviations from sources are noted.
4. Every nontrivial proof (or sorry-stub standing in for one) has a proof sketch.
5. Every public declaration (instances and vendored files excepted) has a docstring
   opening with a natural-language statement of what it asserts
   (`python3 scripts/style_lint.py` checks presence mechanically; statement quality is
   review judgment).
6. `zsh scripts/lean_check.sh <file>` reports zero errors for each touched file.
7. If blueprint content was touched: `python3 scripts/blueprint_validate.py --strict` and
   `python3 scripts/dataset_hygiene.py --strict` pass.

# TCSlib Formalization Workflow

How large formalization campaigns are run in this repository. [`policy.md`](policy.md)
says what landed Lean code must look like; this document says what *process* produces
it. The reference implementation is the Arora-Barak campaign
(`AroraBarakChapter1Plan.md`, complete and audited end to end;
`AroraBarakChapter2Plan.md`, in progress) — file paths below cite its artifacts as
worked examples. Where an older document describes a mechanism this one supersedes
(e.g. the PR-based fill delivery in `AroraBarakChapter1Plan.md` §5, since replaced by
zip delivery), this document records current practice.

```
plan  →  statement phases  →  audit gates  →  fill campaign  →  closure
          (sorry-skeletons)    (per phase)     (epochs/batches)   (attestation, final
                                                                   audit, blueprint)
```

The load-bearing idea: **statements are audited before proofs are attempted.** Lean
already checks proofs; the dominant failure mode of formalization is a wrong or
subtly-weakened *statement*, and that is cheapest to catch while everything is still a
`sorry`. Every phase therefore lands as a compiling skeleton, passes an adversarial
external audit gate, and only then becomes fill work.

## 1. The campaign plan

Each campaign (typically one textbook chapter) begins with a plan file at the repo
root — `<Source>Chapter<N>Plan.md` — containing:

* **Scope**: which results are mandatory core, which are deferred, with source
  citations.
* **Foundation decisions**: the definitional conventions, each with its rationale
  (these are where audits bite; see §3).
* **Architecture and module layout**: directories, namespaces, facades, per policy §1.
* **Phasing**: the statement phases and the anticipated fill epochs.
* **Risks and honest effort assessment**.
* **Open design questions (human review required)**: decisions reserved for a human
  maintainer. Audit rounds *verify* these but never *dispose* of them; each records
  the maintainer's provisional choice and stays open until a human closes it. The
  consolidated register — full statements, cross-links, and status — is
  [`backlog.md`](backlog.md); the plans keep stable numbered stubs, which is what
  audit documents cite.
* **Decision log**: an append-only table. Every methodological decision, every audit
  round's verdict, and every repair round gets a row. The log is the campaign's
  memory; when a decision is reversed, the old row is marked **Superseded** in place,
  never deleted.

## 2. Statement phases (sorry-skeletons)

A phase lands the definitions plus the theorem *statements* of one coherent slice,
every proof a `sorry` under a policy-grade proof sketch (policy §3: the sketch is
written at skeleton time and is the plan; a skeleton whose sketch cannot be written is
not ready to land). Ground rules:

* Definitions and sorried statements only. Proofs appear in a skeleton only for
  definitional-unfolding lemmas whose home module mirrors proved infrastructure (the
  precedent: the `runWith` algebra of `TuringMachine/Nondeterministic.lean`, mirroring
  the vendored `runFrom` lemmas), and any such deviation is flagged in the audit pack
  with the proofs declared part of the audited surface.
* Sketches name their obligations: a sketch that will need a machine construction
  names each sub-machine as an explicit fill obligation, so the eventual brief can
  inherit the list.
* Everything gate-verifies before commit: per-module checks plus a full fresh sweep
  (§6), style lint, and the headline axiom prints.

## 3. Audit gates (between phases)

Right after a skeleton lands — statements frozen — an **external adversarial audit**
runs before any fill or any next phase. The auditor is an LLM from a different vendor,
in a fresh context, reviewing the trusted surface (definitions, statements, sketches,
and any skeleton-time proofs) against the source text.

**Artifacts**, all committed under `audits/` with campaign-scoped names
(`ch2-phase1-*`, `epoch4-*`):

* `…-pack.md` — the auditor's instructions: the audited commit, repository-side
  attestations (freeze by path enumeration, sweep results, admission inventory, axiom
  prints, lint — stated so the auditor can verify or challenge them, with source facts
  kept separate from maintainer execution claims), the under-audit inventory, a
  prioritized brief (the plan's seeded design questions go here), and the findings
  table format with the severity guide: **blocker** (a downstream phase would build on
  a wrong statement) / **major** (fixable but materially misleading) / **minor** /
  **note**. `audits/TEMPLATE.md` is the skeleton.
* `…-bundle.md` — a single uploadable file: the pack verbatim, then every attachment
  under a `## ===== <path> =====` header (prior findings, both plans, `policy.md`,
  the root, and the full module tree).
* A short kickoff message (drafted per round, pasted by the maintainer into a fresh
  auditor chat with the bundle attached).
* `…-findings.md` — the auditor's report, preserved **verbatim**, including anything
  the maintainer disputes. Pack errata found later are acknowledged in the resolutions
  file; shipped packs are never edited retroactively.

**The gate rule**: a gate closes only on a round reporting **zero blockers and zero
majors**. A round with majors triggers repairs and a full re-audit round (minors may
be swept in the closing commit and re-verified). Repairs adopt the auditor's own
constructions where supplied, are re-gated, and are recorded in the decision log; when
the loop closes, `…-resolutions.md` summarizes every round, every repair, and the note
dispositions. The complete worked example is the three-round
`audits/ch2-phase1-{pack,findings,reaudit-…,round3-…,resolutions}.md` loop.

Audits complement, never replace, in-Lean sanity theorems — the machine-checked and
permanent form of the same checks.

## 4. The fill campaign (epochs and batches)

With all phase gates closed, the audited-true sorries are filled in **epochs** —
sequential, ordered by risk retirement, with an audit round at each epoch boundary —
each consisting of **batches** run in parallel by cloud agents with disjoint file
ownership, from self-contained briefs in `briefs/`.

**Binding batch ground rules** (full text repeated in every brief):

1. **Exclusive file ownership.** Helpers live `private` in owned files; a lemma that
   belongs in a shared file is *requested* in the report and added serially at epoch
   merge, flagged for the next audit.
2. **Statement freeze.** Audited declarations are never renamed, re-signatured, or
   re-stated by fill work. A target that looks unprovable as stated is an
   *escalation*, reported with the obstruction — never "fixed" inline.
3. **Verification per batch**: the check script (§6) over the owned files, zero
   `error:` lines, sorries only at documented out-of-scope items.

**Delivery is by zip, not PR.** Each batch returns an archive containing `REPORT.md`,
the full source files, a `git format-patch` series, a git bundle, the batch's sweep
log, the axiom-print log, and `SHA256SUMS`. The maintainer verifies before
integrating: checksums; the statement freeze (comment-stripped comparison of every
audited signature); enumeration of any removals; public-declaration drift; a full
fresh sweep; the headline axiom prints; and the **duplication ledger** — every
private copy of existing proved material in the delivery enumerated, with each
touched file's cumulative copied-material count and fraction. If a delivery pushes a
file past **one fifth copied material**, or adds copies to a file that already
received copies in an earlier epoch, the maintainer opens a `backlog.md` §1
human-review item before the epoch's audit pack ships — no discretion. Integration
is `git am -3` from the patch series, preserving the agent's authorship. Large fills that exhaust one agent's budget
continue via a continuation brief to a fresh agent (the `universal` B2 precedent).

**Epoch boundaries**: the maintainer re-runs the full sweep, produces a **drift
attestation** (§6), and prepares the epoch's audit pack with elaboration evidence
and the epoch's **duplication ledger**, which the auditor verifies independently
(audit template failure mode 5); the epoch's gate follows the same
zero-blockers/majors rule as phase gates, and a debt major closes only by explicit
human acknowledgment recorded in the resolutions file.

## 5. Closure

When the last sorry falls: a zero-sorry sweep with build evidence; a campaign-wide
drift attestation against the audited baselines; a final audit pack covering the fill
rounds; and the blueprint increment — dependency graph from `.ilean` artifacts,
`scripts/blueprint_{enumerate,assemble,validate}.py`, blueprint-writer agents, with
the blueprint **late-bound** throughout (extraction only at boundaries; no blueprint
LaTeX hand-written ahead of the Lean; `blueprint/BLUEPRINT_PIPELINE.md` has the
pipeline detail).

## 6. Verification tooling

* **`scripts/lean_check_tree.sh <module>`** — the campaign's elaboration gate: a
  direct `lean` invocation per module (**`lake build` is banned on campaign
  branches** — see the Chapter-1 decision log), emitting fresh `.olean`s into a
  scratch tree. Pass requires exit 0, zero `error:` lines, *and* a fresh olean, so a
  stale artifact can never satisfy the check. The full sweep runs it over every
  module, in dependency order, from `scripts/ab_ch1_module_order.txt`:

  ```
  ( while read -r m; do bash scripts/lean_check_tree.sh "$m" || exit 1; done \
      < scripts/ab_ch1_module_order.txt )
  ```

  Admission counting is by `declaration uses 'sorry'` warnings in the sweep log; the
  expected count is attested in every pack.
* **`scripts/campaign_style_lint.py`** (named `scripts/style_lint.py` until the
  main merge, which adopted main's per-file policy linter under that name — the
  historical audit logs' invocations refer to this tool) — mechanical policy checks: statement-prose docstrings,
  sketch-before-sorry, file sizes, `## References`, facade coverage. Campaign
  baseline: zero FAIL (legacy pre-campaign files outside the audited surface are
  tolerated and listed).
* **Axiom prints** — `#print axioms` for every headline theorem on the *fresh* olean
  tree: closed results must show exactly `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`;
  sorried statements show `sorryAx`, and any other axiom is a stop-the-line event.
* **Drift attestation** — the anti-tamper check between audited baselines: strip
  comments from every module, compare both the **multiset** of declarations and the
  **ordered declaration sequence** against the baseline, and enumerate public
  declarations (gained / lost / changed) so that "nothing audited moved" is a checked
  claim, not an impression.
* **Vendored files** are frozen at their recorded upstream pin and periodically
  byte-compared against upstream; local modifications live only in the header list.

## 7. Relationship to the other documents

* [`policy.md`](policy.md) — the standards this workflow enforces (modularity,
  attribution, sketches, review checklist).
* [`lean-glossary.md`](lean-glossary.md) — the Lean/Mathlib jargon appearing in
  declaration names and docstrings (fuel, Sigma, `Prop` vs `Bool`, the naming
  grammar, …), for readers fluent in TCS but not in Lean.
* [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) / `.claude/` — the sorry-ladder proof technique and agent
  roster; useful *inside* a fill batch, but campaign verification runs through §6, not
  through `lake build` or editor-only checks.
* [`blueprint/BLUEPRINT_PIPELINE.md`](blueprint/BLUEPRINT_PIPELINE.md) — blueprint
  generation and validation.
* [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md) — main-branch
  build and CI; campaign branches deviate as recorded in their decision logs.

## Brief for the auditor

You are auditing the **trusted surface** of a Lean 4 formalization: definitions, theorem
statements, and remaining `sorry`s. The proofs that exist are machine-checked — do not
review tactic scripts for correctness. The failure modes you are hunting are:

1. **Infidelity** — a definition that does not mean what the cited source means.
2. **Trivialization** — a definition or statement satisfiable for degenerate reasons
   (vacuous hypotheses, a class that collapses, an encoding that makes a theorem empty).
3. **Unprovability** — a `sorry`d statement that is false as stated, or whose stated
   form is subtly weaker/stronger than intended (boundary cases: empty input, `n = 0`,
   `k = 0` tapes, constant absorption).
4. **Missing hypotheses** — especially finiteness, positivity, and well-formedness side
   conditions the informal source leaves implicit.
5. **Debt** — wholesale duplication of existing proved material (private copies of
   another file's declarations, re-derivations of registry routines), even when
   disclosed and mechanically forced by file ownership. Report it at **major** with
   the proposed fix "human acknowledgment required": it does not block the gate on
   soundness, but the gate must not close without the human maintainer explicitly
   accepting the debt and naming its scheduled resolution. Screen for it
   cumulatively — verify the pack's duplication ledger (per-file copied-material
   totals) rather than assessing each copy in isolation.

For **every definition** in scope: restate it in your own mathematical English *without
looking at the docstring first*, then compare your restatement against the cited source
location, and report any daylight. For **every `sorry`d theorem**: argue in 2-5 sentences
why it is true as literally stated, or exhibit the problem (ideally a concrete
counterexample or degenerate instance). Attempt at least ⟨3⟩ *adversarial
instantiations* — concrete pathological objects plugged into the definitions to check
they behave as the theory intends. Propose any machine-checkable sanity theorems you
believe are missing.

Do not give a blanket approval. Your deliverable is the findings table; an empty table
must be accompanied by the per-definition restatements that justify it.

## Scope

| Item | Where |
|---|---|
| Lean files under audit | ⟨list of files, with line ranges if partial⟩ |
| Source text | ⟨book/paper, edition, page/theorem numbers — auditor must have it at hand⟩ |
| Plan/context documents | `AroraBarakChapter1Plan.md`, `policy.md` §2-3 ⟨adjust⟩ |
| Out of scope | tactic proofs; vendored files' upstream design ⟨adjust⟩ |

## Known deviations (declared by the authors — verify they are benign, flag any others)

⟨Bulleted list: every deviation the docstrings declare, one line each.⟩

## Specific questions for this phase

⟨Numbered list of the doubts the authors actually have. Be concrete.⟩

## Findings format (auditor fills)

| # | Severity | File · declaration | Claim | Evidence / counterexample | Proposed fix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | blocker / major / minor / note | | | | |

Severity guide: **blocker** = a downstream phase would build on a wrong statement;
**major** = statement is fixable but materially misleading as is, **or** accumulated
debt (failure mode 5) that the gate may not close over without explicit human
acknowledgment; **minor** = edge case or naming/attribution defect; **note** =
observation, no change required.

# Machine-construction library — design document

Status: **FROZEN 2026-10-03** — the open decisions in §9 were resolved by the
user (resolutions recorded inline there). No code exists yet; every Lean
snippet below is an interface *shape*, not a final signature — final
signatures are fixed at spec time and audited.

Evidence base: the epoch-2 checkpoint integration (decision-log row,
2026-10-03). All five open fill frontiers are concrete-machine construction;
147 private helpers were delivered in one epoch, dominated by re-built
copiers, scanners, counters, capture wrappers, and phase glue. The
capture/silence wrapper alone now has four private incarnations
(`universalCaptureTM`, `enumCaptureTM`, `acceptTM`, and the private engine
inside `Composition.lean`'s `exists_cond`).

Prior-art disposition (2026-10-03 discussion): Mathlib's TM2 framework is a
stack-machine model whose poly-time layer contains one machine (the identity)
and no composition theorem; its inter-model compilations are semantics-only.
Decision: build on our own `FinTM` multi-tape model, which owns all the
quantitative assets; adopt the *design idiom* of Mathlib's TM1 statement
language (labelled structured control) for how named machines are written,
import nothing.

## 1. Goals and non-goals

**Goal.** Make "build a finite machine with a proved polynomial time bound"
a library-call activity rather than a bespoke construction, at the
granularity the fill briefs actually need: parse, measure, evaluate a
polynomial, search, split, compare, copy, emit, run a subroutine silently,
branch, loop.

**Non-goals.**
- No deep-embedded language, no verified compiler, no cost-sound surface
  syntax. (Mature end state; not justified by the remaining campaign.)
- No model change, no Mathlib TM2 dependency, no space bounds (the design
  must not *obstruct* a later space story, but proves nothing about space).
- No retroactive migration of audited epoch-1/2 proofs (see §8).

## 2. Architecture

Three layers over the existing run calculus:

```
Layer 2  CONTROL      timed cond · loop · capture/silence · halt-redirect
Layer 1  PRIMITIVES   named machines with ComputesFunInTime specs, ABI-compliant
Layer 0  (exists)     run calculus · bufferedCompTM/computesFunInTime_comp ·
                      bufferTape/virtualMove relocation · DecidesInTime
Consumer EXISTENTIAL  PolyTimeComputable / ∈ P corollaries only
```

**Design rule (the bridge lesson).** Constructive layers export *named*
`def` machines plus spec theorems; existential packaging (`∃ M c, …`)
appears only at the consumer layer. Quantifier shape is where audits bite —
a consumer may never need to bound an existential witness.

**Composition stance.** The default sequencing mechanism is *whole-machine*
composition via the public `bufferedCompTM` (already proved, `c = 2`
overhead): chain function machines, don't hand-build phase transitions. The
epoch-2 agents could not do this only because (i) the component machines
didn't exist, (ii) branching has no timed combinator, (iii) loops have no
combinator at all. The library supplies exactly (i)–(iii) and otherwise
stops people from proving phase compositions by hand.

## 3. The calling convention (ABI)

The model already gives whole machines a clean boundary: read-only input
tape, `k` work tapes, write-only (append-only) output tape, start at
`initCfg` with blank work tapes. The ABI therefore governs the only places
where configurations cross a seam *inside* a construction: round boundaries
of the loop combinator and entry/exit of wrapped subroutines.

**Canonical configuration** (the single formal notion, defined once):

- designated *state tapes* hold the round data (specified contents, heads at
  origin);
- all *scratch tapes* are blank with heads at origin;
- the output is empty (nothing emitted yet);
- the control state is a designated live anchor.

Loop bodies and wrappers prove "canonical-in ⟹ canonical-out" lemmas; the
combinators own everything else (startup from `initCfg`, final emission,
fuel exhaustion). Proposed discipline for scratch: **the body restores its
own scratch to blank as part of its contract** (it knows its own footprint,
so the proof is its own invariant run backwards), supported by a generic
`clearTM` primitive that sweeps a length-`m` region in `2m + 2` steps.
Rationale: 2A's killer was a *generic* reset proof; a body-specific restore
is mechanical. The alternative (combinator-driven clearing bounded by the
visited-region lemma in `Sweep.lean`) is recorded as the fallback if
body-restore proves heavier than expected. **[Open decision 9.2]**

**Multi-argument functions.** The ABI for arity > 1 is the existing
`pairEncode` idiom; the codec machines (§4) make it mechanical. No tuple
tapes, no new conventions.

**Deciders.** A decider is a function machine emitting the singleton
indicator (`[true]`/`[false]`), i.e. `DecidesInTime` as it already exists.
The decision layer (§6) builds AND/OR/NOT/guard over that, so `∈ P` goals
decompose without touching configurations.

## 4. Layer 1 — the primitive catalog

Rule of admission: a primitive enters the catalog only with **two named
customers** among the open frontiers (2A controller, 2B `choiceVerifier` +
reverse direction, 2C two verifier memberships, 2D `D-MEM`/`D-WRAP`/`D-EMIT`)
and the E3/E4 briefs. Current cut — 12 entries:

| # | Primitive | Spec (shape) | Source | Customers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | `copyTM` | id in `n + 1` | exists (`Composition.lean`) | everywhere |
| P2 | `constTM w` | `fun _ => w` in `\|w\| + 1` | exists | 2D D-EMIT, E4 |
| P3 | `prefixTM w` | `fun x => w ++ x` in `\|w\| + \|x\| + 1` | harvest 2C (promotion already requested) | 2C, 2D D-EMIT |
| P4 | `lengthTM` | `fun x => bits \|x\|` (binary length) | new (2D's counter composition is the engine) | 2B, 2C, 2D D-MEM |
| P5 | `polyEvalTM C c` | `fun x => bits (C·(\|x\|+1)^c)` and unary variant | harvest 2D (`polyUnaryTM` + counter) | 2A startup, 2B, 2C |
| P6 | `pairSplitTM` / `pairJoinTM` | the `pairEncode` codec, both directions | new over existing grammar lemmas (2C/2D parsers are drafts) | 2C, 2D D-MEM/D-WRAP, E4 |
| P7 | `replicateTM` | `fun x => List.replicate (f \|x\|) true` for emitted-count `f` | harvest 2D emission chains | 2D D-EMIT, E4 ledger |
| P8 | `compareTM` | equality / `≤` test of two encoded numbers, singleton verdict | new (small) | 2B, 2C bound re-check |
| P9 | `scanLastTM` | split at last `true` (strip discipline), failure verdict | harvest 2C (`stripCertificate` semantics are proved; machine is new) | 2C, 2B split search |
| P10 | `searchTM` | least `i ≤ n` with `p i`, for `p` decided by a supplied decider on encoded `i` | new (uses W1 + loop L) | 2B split, 2C split |
| P11 | `incrementTM` | fixed-width binary increment + overflow flag + rewind | harvest 2A (`enumCarryTM`) | 2A, E3 padding counters, ch3 |
| P12 | `clearTM` | blank a length-`m` region, `2m + 2` steps | new (trivial) | loop bodies, 2A reset |

Each entry ships as: named `def` + one `ComputesFunInTime`/`DecidesInTime`
spec + an ABI-compliance lemma (canonical-out where applicable). Internal
idiom: TM1-style labelled control (a small inductive of labelled phases with
a `step` match), which is what 2D's `PolyControl` was reaching for.

Harvesting means **reimplementation against the ABI with the original proof
as the template** — the audited originals stay untouched in place; see §8.

## 5. Layer 2 — control

**W1. `captureTM` (silence/capture wrapper).** Given machine `D`: run `D`
with every emission suppressed and recorded — core variant records the full
output on a dedicated capture tape; register corollary extracts the first
bit for deciders. Spec: configuration-preserving lockstep, emission on the
halting transition included (the trap every private build re-proved), return
within `T_D + 1` into a live dispatch state, physical output empty.
Consolidates all four private incarnations; the obligations are already
enumerated by the phase-1 and phase-4 audit tables. **[Open decision 9.3 on
variants]**

**W2. `haltRedirectTM`.** 2C's `acceptTM` pattern as a named transformation:
halt iff captured bit is `b`, else enter the one-state live loop (with its
two-line non-halting lemma). Customers: 2A overflow wiring, HALT-style
control modifications, ch3 diagonalization.

**W3. `condTM` (timed branch).** The timed version of `exists_cond`: given
decider `D` (time `T_D`) and machines `M₁, M₂` (times `T₁, T₂`), a named
machine computing `if p x then f₁ x else f₂ x` within
`c · (T_D + max T₁ T₂ + overhead)`. Engine: W1 + the existing private
capture machinery of `Composition.lean`, made public and timed. Customers:
2C/2D reject-on-malformed guards, every parser.

**L. `loopTM` (the centerpiece — bounded loop with tape-resident state).**
Interface factored from 2A's admitted `enumMachine_contracts`, which is the
validated draft:

```
-- SHAPE ONLY. Final quantifiers to be fixed at spec time, audited.
structure LoopSpec where
  (round data σ, encoded on the state tapes; canonical config family cfg : σ → Cfg)
  (body B; fuel R : ℕ → ℕ; per-round budget T : ℕ → ℕ)
  contract : ∀ s, canonical s →
    within T n, B either EMITS a final verdict and halts,
    or reaches canonical (next s)      -- accept-or-advance
  exhaustion : after R n rounds without emission, halted rejection

theorem loopTM_decides …  :
  (loop machine) decides/computes … within
    startup + R n · (T n + c) + c'
```

The combinator owns: startup from `initCfg` (via an init machine composed
with `bufferedCompTM`), the fuel countdown (P11 as the engine), the final
rejection, and the summation. The body owns: accept-or-advance and its own
scratch restore (§3). 2A's proved `enumLoop_run` is the summation lemma's
template; `enumMachine_contracts` then becomes a *library instantiation*
rather than a bespoke admission. Customers: 2A (directly), P10, 2B reverse
direction, E3 padding, E4 stage loops, ch3 clocked simulation.

**Explicitly deferred from layer 2:** a general tape-embedding transformation
(run a `k`-tape machine on a tape subset of a larger machine). The wrappers
and the loop internally preserve "retained tapes" the way 2A/2B already do;
if a third site needs the general form, it gets designed then — not
speculatively now.

## 6. Decision layer (consumer-facing)

Over `DecidesInTime`: negation, conjunction/disjunction (W1-composition),
`guard` (W3 with constant-reject branch), `decideOfFun` (function machine +
P8-style final test), and the `∈ P` glue through the existing
`mem_P_of_dtime_le`/`mem_P_iff`. Everything here is existential and cheap;
its purpose is that goals like `pairedVerifier C c V ∈ P` decompose into
catalog calls plus the semantic lemmas the agents already proved.

## 7. Placement, naming, policy

- New subdirectory `TCSlib/Complexity/TuringMachine/Build/` (precedent:
  `Robustness/`): `Convention.lean` (ABI notions + canonical-config lemmas),
  `Primitives.lean` (P1–P12; split if the 600-line target demands),
  `Wrappers.lean` (W1–W3), `Loop.lean` (L). Namespace `Turing.FinTM`
  throughout (no new namespace).
- Order list: insert after `Simulation`/`Composition`/`Sweep`, before
  `Encoding` — the library depends only on the run calculus and the public
  relocation/composition machinery; nothing Chapter-1-headline depends on it
  (no import cycles, Chapter-1 statements untouched).
- Attribution: standard constructions, tagged [AB09 §1.2–1.4] where the text
  has them (claim-by-claim as policy requires); module docstring records the
  TM1 statement-language idiom as a design reference (Mathlib) alongside the
  Asperti–Ricciotti and Forster–Kunze precedents.
- This is frozen Chapter-1 surface growth → it gets its own audit (§9.4 for
  the vehicle). Spec statements land sorried first (statement-phase
  discipline), the pack leads with the quantifier shapes (ABI, W1 lockstep,
  L's contract) since that is where this design can be wrong.

## 8. Harvest and migration policy

- Harvest = reimplement against the ABI using the original proof as
  template. Originals (2A/2B/2C/2D privates, audited epoch-1 material) stay
  byte-identical; no re-audit of closed work.
- Deduplication (retiring privates in favor of library calls) is an **E5
  closure task**, recorded in the backlog, not done opportunistically.
- 2C's pending shared-lemma requests (`prefixTM`/`fixedPair`) are subsumed
  by P3 + P6 and get their disposition in this design's audit round.

## 9. Decisions (resolved by the user, 2026-10-03)

1. **Primitive cut** (§4): P1–P12 confirmed as listed.
2. **Scratch discipline** (§3): body-restores-scratch, with
   combinator-driven clearing via the visited-region bound recorded as the
   fallback if body-restore proves heavier than expected.
3. **Capture variants** (§5 W1): tape-capture core + register corollary.
4. **Audit vehicle**: one shared infrastructure round carrying the library
   spec layer *and* the Chapter-1 bridge export.
5. **Build sequencing**: campaign structure — maintainer writes the spec
   layer serially (quantifier-sensitive), shared audit round, then fills
   dispatched as harvest-adaptation batches, the loop fill flagged for
   continuation budget.
6. **Naming**: `Build/` and the P/W/L working names stand; any rename
   happens before the spec audit (renames after it are drift).

## 9a. Spec-phase refinements (2026-10-03, recorded when the spec layer landed)

The spec layer (`TuringMachine/Build/{Convention,Wrappers,Loop,Primitives}.lean`)
realizes the catalog with these refinements against §4–§5, none touching the
frozen §9 decisions:

- **Seam notion**: `Cfg.ofWords` is a *constructor* (anchor state, input head
  at 1, word-per-tape from the origin via `bufferTape`, heads at origin,
  empty output) and seam contracts are `runFrom`-equations against it —
  rewrite-friendly, and `initCfg` is provably the empty-words seam.
- **Packaging**: contracts are existential in the house idiom of
  `Composition.lean`; fills implement named private machines and close them.
  The §2 named-machine rule is realized as quantifier discipline inside each
  statement (machine fixed after its parameters, before all inputs — the
  bridge lesson), not as global naming.
- **P6** is realized as `pairEncodeFixed` (provably an instance of P3 at the
  doubled-word-plus-separator prefix) plus threaded extractors
  `pairFst`/`pairSnd`/`pairValid`.
- **P7** is subsumed by P5's unary clause, whose instances are what the
  emission customers consume. **P8** is realized in threaded form
  (`pairLenCheck` on `pairEncode a b`, so the original input travels with
  the payload and the audited original-bound re-check is against it).
  **P12** has no standalone contract: clearing is intra-machine, part of the
  loop fill's toolkit.
- **W1** is host-parametric (`captureAction`/`captureCfg` transformers + one
  lockstep equation guarded by source liveness), so consumers embed the
  source into their own controller state type; the register corollary is
  derived at fill time. **W2** is the closed `redirectTM` with an
  `Option Bool` last-emission register (`none` = no emission yet; a source
  with empty output never halts the redirect).
- The lint-mandated construction sketches surfaced a real obligation worth
  recording: append-only output means every parser/extractor must **buffer
  until validity is known** — the output-silence discipline reappears at
  the primitive level (extractors, strip, increment's overflow detection).

## 9b. Round-2 repairs (2026-10-03, after `audits/ch1-infra-findings.md`)

The round-1 audit refuted `exists_loopTM` (blocker: a zero-step identity
"advance" made the hypotheses vacuous while the conclusion violated the
input-head information bound; major: quantifying rounds over *all* state
words at budget `T |x|` excluded the intended customers) and rejected
disposition D5 (missing dynamic assembly and result-bearing search). The
repairs, all in the spec layer:

**The loop contract, redesigned.** Rounds take positive time (`0 < t`);
rounds are required only on words satisfying an input-indexed
admissibility invariant `Inv x s`, established at `s0` and preserved by
the step; and `stepF`/`acceptF`/payload take the input explicitly (the
enumerator's acceptance runs the verifier on `x ++ s`). Two forms:
`exists_loopTM` (Boolean verdict) and the new `exists_loopFindTM` (first
accepting orbit point's payload; `[]` on exhaustion). The countdown sketch
debits from the **second** anchor entry, so `R = 0` still checks `s0 x`
(round-1 finding 4), and the amortized-borrow budget argument was
validated by the auditor.

**Instantiation tables** (the customer-coverage evidence round 1 asked
for; `m n := C·(n+1)^c` abbreviates the certificate-width polynomial):

| Parameter | Enumerator (2A's `enumMachine_contracts`) | Split search (P10) |
|---|---|---|
| `Inv x s` | `s.length = m x.length` | `s.length ≤ x.length + 1` |
| `s0 x` | `List.replicate (m x.length) false` | `[]` |
| `stepF x s` | `(incFixed s).getD s` (stall on overflow keeps the width) | `if s.length ≤ x.length then s ++ [true] else s` (stall keeps `Inv` step-closed) |
| `acceptF x s` | the captured verifier's verdict on `x ++ s` | `s.length + C·(s.length+1)^e = x.length` |
| payload | — (decision form) | `pairEncode (x.take s.length) (x.drop s.length)`, never `[]` |
| `R n` | `2^(m n) − 1` | `n` |
| fuel bits | `Nat.bits (2^(m n) − 1) = replicate (m n) true` — writable within `T` | `Nat.bits n` — writable within `T` |
| orbit, `i ≤ R n` | all `2^(m n)` width-`m` words, each once (`incFixed` enumeration; the stall is beyond fuel) | the candidates `0, …, n` in unary; `find?` = `solveSplit`'s least solution |
| conclusion shape | `[decide (∃ u, u.length = m n ∧ verifier accepts x ++ u)]` | exactly P10's stated function |

Both invariants bound the state-word length by the input, which is
precisely what dissolves the round-1 finding-2 obstruction (no body is
asked to transform words longer than its budget can traverse).

**Catalog additions** (finding 3): P13 `pairConcat`
(`pairEncode x u ↦ x ++ u`, the D-WRAP shape), P14 `pairDup`
(`x ↦ pairEncode x x`), and the combinator C1 `pairMapSnd` (transform a
pair's payload, retain its head; the data-retaining assembly sequential
composition cannot provide). D-EMIT's nested quadruple then factors as
`pairEncodeFixed α₀ ∘ pairMapSnd (unary-runs generator) ∘ pairDup`, and
D-MEM's parser chains through the extractors with `pairMapSnd` carrying
retained components. **P10 narrowing recorded**: the implemented search is
the fixed length-equation search, not the catalog's supplied-predicate
search; the general form is `exists_loopFindTM` itself.

## 9c. Round-3 repairs (2026-10-03, after `audits/ch1-infra-r2-findings.md`)

Round 2 passed the redesigned loops, P13/P14/C1, and the §9b tables, and
discharged both round-1 refutations; its one major (finding 1) showed the
loop's *final-answer* conclusion cannot discharge the frozen
`enumMachine_contracts`, which is a *configuration-level* contract — the
auditor's delay machine answers correctly yet violates every per-round
bound. Repairs:

**The configuration-level export.** `exists_loopCfgTM` (same hypotheses
as the decision form) concludes with the host's round-configuration
family: startup ≤ `c·(T+1)` reaching `cfg 0`, empty output at rounds
`0…R`, per-round accept-or-advance segments each within `c·(T+1)`, and
the halted `[false]` terminal at index `R+1`. The decision form becomes a
fill-time corollary through an already-halted-terminal summation lemma
plus monotonicity (R3-1: the frozen `loop_run` requires an empty-output
terminal, so it is not invoked directly on the exported family). **Index/budget
translation to `enumMachine_contracts`** (under the §9b enumerator
instantiation, `w := m n`): candidates `2^w = R n + 1`, so the terminal
index matches; the customer's uniform bound `b·(n + w + 1)^e` dominates
`c·(T n + 1)` once `T` is chosen as a polynomial in `n + w` and `b, e`
absorb `c` and its degree; the per-round indicator matches via the fill's
orbit bridge `(stepF x)^[i] (s0 x) = enumWord w i` (little-endian rank
enumeration, `incFixed` = `enumInc` per the round-2 vocabulary note).

**Vocabulary coefficient shift (round-2 note 5, adopted).** The proved
equalities are `splitAtLastTrue = stripCertificate`, `incFixed = enumInc`,
and `solveSplit (C+1) c = certificateSplit C c` — the split-search
equality is false without the shift (R3-3 corrected this pointer). Consequently the padded-verifier pipeline uses P10 at
`(C + 1, c)` while P8 keeps `(C, c)` for the original witness bound.

**General pairing assembly (round-2 item 10's derivation, adopted
verbatim as the canonical recipe).** For computed `f, g`:
`H x := pairEncode (f x) []` (P14 + C1 at the constant-empty function);
`s x := pairEncode x (H x)`; `t x := pairEncode (s x) (g x)` (P14 + C1,
the second with `g ∘ pairFst`); then
`pairSnd (pairConcat (t x)) = pairEncode (f x) (g x)` — the
self-delimiting grammar makes concatenation-into-payload well-formed at
every stage. A C1 call on `pairEncode a b` computes `g b` only; any
cross-component operation goes through this retained-whole-request
pattern, never through C1 directly (round-2 item 10's D-MEM caveat).

**D5 scope (round-2 items 6/10).** The disposition is re-issued for the
epoch-2 frontiers and P10 only; the E3/E4 rows are component-level
plausibility and their full coverage check is deferred to those epochs'
brief audits, where the six-stage/boundary/ledger tables are in scope.

## 10. Cost and sequencing (estimate, campaign points)

| Work | Est. | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Spec layer (all signatures + ABI) | 8 | maintainer, serial; the design-sensitive part |
| Spec audit round | — | rides with bridge export per 9.4 |
| P1–P12 fills | 14 | mostly harvest-adaptation; parallelizable |
| W1–W3 fills | 9 | W1 obligations already tabulated by past audits |
| L fill | 13 | the real risk concentration; continuation budget anticipated |
| **Total** | **≈ 44** | one mid-size batch equivalent |

Sequencing: freeze this design → spec statements + bridge export → shared
audit round → fills → **then** E2 continuation briefs, which cite the
library instead of re-deriving machines. E2 continuations, E3, E4, and the
ch3 skeleton are the customers that pay this back; the loop combinator is
the piece to watch for slippage.

## 11. The emitter increment (proposed 2026-10-05, post-E3 integration)

**Evidence.** E3's outcome maps the library boundary exactly: everything
recognizer-shaped closed in one round through the catalog (3B's memberships
via `computesFunInTime_splitSolve 1 1` + capture + the audited wrappers; 3D
via P10 + capture + composition), while both stalls sit on the producer
side — 3B at a streaming transducer (`satRedTM` states 9–34, defined,
unproved), 3A at a loop body that must internally run an evaluator and emit
a payload, over a width family the catalog's split instance doesn't cover.
The loop contracts deliberately require **empty output through every round**
(round-2/3 audit repairs), and composition offers only input-pipelining —
there is no output-append mode anywhere in the library. E4's summit
(`SAT_NPHard`, 15 pts, continuation certain) is an emitter of exactly this
shape: a per-index loop appending clause groups under the six-stage
output-silence contract with an exact serialization-length ledger.

**Rule of admission check** (§4): every item below has at least two named
customers among 3B-cont, 4A, 4B, and 3A-cont.

### E1. `emitLoop` — the emitting loop (control layer)

The loop engine's output clause generalized: rounds append exact per-round
emissions instead of staying silent. Shape (final quantifiers at spec time,
audited):

```
-- SHAPE ONLY. Sibling of exists_loopCfgTM, sharing its host machinery.
Inv, s0, stepF as in the decision loop; additionally
  emitF : input → σ → List Bool        -- the exact chunk of round i
contract: startup ≤ c(T+1); per-round segments ≤ c(T+1); positive
  first-return; for every i ≤ R:
    (cfg i).output = (List.range i).flatMap (fun j => emitF x (stepF^[j] s0))
  terminal: halted, output = the full concatenation (no verdict bit — the
  machine COMPUTES the concatenation; a deciding variant is NOT included).
```

Body obligations unchanged (accept-or-advance becomes advance-and-emit;
scratch restore per §3/9.2). The summation lemma is `loop_run`'s template
with the output clause threaded. **Customers:** 4A (the per-snapshot clause
emitter — the design driver), 3B-cont (`satRedTM`'s streaming core as an
instantiation), 4B (dual reduction emitter).

### E2. `emitPhase` — the forwarding wrapper (control layer)

The dual of W1: run an embedded transducer `T` (a `ComputesFunInTime`
contract) inside a host, with `T`'s emissions landing on the **host's**
output tape, source tapes isolated, halt redirected to a live return state;
lockstep lemma in `capture_run`'s mold with "physical output = host prefix
++ T's output so far". This is what lets a catalog transducer serve as one
emission stage of a larger machine — today's only option is whole-machine
input-pipelining. **Customers:** E1's per-round chunk calls (4A emits each
clause group through a sub-transducer), 3B-cont (fresh-literal chain
emission), 3A-cont marginally (the success payload `pairEncode` emission).

### E3′. Stream primitives (catalog rows P16–P18)

| # | Primitive | Spec (shape) | Source | Customers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| P16 | `tokenStepTM` | consume one self-delimiting token (unary index / marker) from the input head, land head after it, expose the token in control | harvest: 3B's proved `satScanTM`/`satSyntaxStep`, 3D's six-state scan, 2D's parsers (fourth re-derivation otherwise) | 3B-cont, 4A, 4B |
| P17 | `chunkEmitTM w` / parametric | append a control-determined word to output, `\|w\|` steps, no tape movement | new (trivial); the per-token emission atom | E1 bodies, 4A |
| P18 | `unaryAccTM` | dedicated-tape unary accumulator: append one, read-length-in-binary via P4 composition, rewind | harvest: 3B's proved counter stages (`satRedCounter_write`, `satRed_maxOnes`, startup to state 9) | 3B-cont, 4A fresh indices |

### E4′. `splitSolveWith` — width-parametric split search (control layer)

Generalize P15's split search from the hardwired polynomial family to a
hypothesis-supplied width evaluator: given a machine `E` with a captured
`ComputesFunInTime (fun s => bits (f s.length)) T_E` contract and
monotonicity of `n ↦ n + f n`, a machine solving `n + f n = m` (first
success payload `pairEncode (take n) (drop n)`, exhaustion verdict) within
the loopFind envelope over `T_E`. **Harvest source:** 3A-cont's bespoke
body, whose contracts are already displayed in its REPORT — build the
parametric form against that template once it lands (or directly, if this
increment executes first). **Customers:** 3A-cont's equation (plug the
proved `e3_exp_bits_timed`), every future padding argument (ch3+ time
hierarchy pads the same way).

### Placement, cost, open decisions

- **Placement:** E1 extends `Loop.lean` **in-file** to reuse the audited
  `loopHost` privates (a separate `Build/Emit.lean` cannot see them — the
  D7 cross-file-privates qualification; re-deriving the host would be a
  second 2,500-line proof). `Loop.lean`'s size exception grows and the D7
  split trails as already recorded. E2 joins `Wrappers.lean`; P16–P18 join
  `Primitives.lean`; E4′ joins `Loop.lean` beside P15's engine.
- **Non-goals:** no deciding variant of the emitting loop (compose E1 with
  the existing decision layer instead); no general transducer algebra; no
  speculative tape-embedding (unchanged from §5's deferral).
- **Cost estimate:** spec layer 4; one shared-infra audit round (the ch1
  pattern, expected lighter — one host extension, not a new host); fills:
  E1 8, E2 4, P16–P18 5, E4′ 6 — **≈ 27 points**, roughly the L batch.
- **Sequencing:** freeze this section → spec statements → audit round →
  fills → 3B-cont consumes E1/E2/P16–P18; 4A's brief cites the layer
  instead of a bespoke emitter. **3A-cont dispatches in parallel, bespoke**
  (disjoint ownership; its body becomes E4′'s harvest template; later
  dedup is a recorded E5-style maintainer task, never the fill's).
- **Open decisions (user):** (11.1) approve the increment and this scope;
  (11.2) E1 as a sibling contract beside `exists_loopCfgTM` (recommended)
  vs a generalization replacing it (touches audited statements — not
  recommended); (11.3) whether 4A's brief waits for this gate to close
  (recommended) or anticipates it.

## 11a. Spec-phase refinements (2026-10-05, recorded when the emitter spec landed)

Decisions 11.1–11.3 resolved by the user (2026-10-05): increment approved;
E1 is a **sibling** contract beside `exists_loopCfgTM` (no audited statement
is generalized or touched); 4A's brief **waits** for this gate.

Refinements against §11 as drafted, all narrowing:

1. **P17 is subsumed** (no new statement): a constant chunk emission is
   `emitPhase` (E2) applied to the existing P2 `constTM` — recorded here
   the way D4 recorded the prefix/fixed-pair subsumptions.
   *[Superseded by §11b item 6 and §11c: the discharging rule is body
   finite control for fixed words, or `exists_emitCallTM` for computed
   chunks — never the private `constTM` (round-2 audit, finding 3).]*
2. **P18 narrowed to `computesFunInTime_appendBit`**: the drafted
   accumulator row conflated the append atom with cross-phase persistence,
   and persistence is already the loop engine's state-word mechanism; the
   catalog takes only the atom.
3. **E4′ lives in `Primitives.lean`**, not `Loop.lean`: its conclusion
   speaks `pairEncode`, which `Loop.lean` does not import, and P15's own
   public contract already lives there — the engine/contract split follows
   P15 exactly. Its pure vocabulary `solveSplitWith` joins `Convention.lean`
   beside `solveSplit`, which it definitionally generalizes.
4. **E1 is function-level only** (`exists_emitLoopTM` concluding a
   `ComputesFunInTime` of the chunk concatenation): all three named
   customers deliver `PolyTimeComputable` reductions, i.e. function-level
   contracts, and in-host composition of an emitter is E2's job, which
   takes function-level transducers. The round-2 lesson (final-answer vs
   configuration gap) was checked against each customer before choosing
   this form; a configuration-level export would follow the round-3
   precedent if a consumer ever surfaces.
5. **No emission-size hypothesis on E1**: the round seam equality itself
   bounds each chunk by the round's duration (output grows by at most one
   symbol per step), so the statement carries no redundant bound to drift.

Spec surface: **five sorried contracts** (`Turing.emit_run`,
`Turing.FinTM.exists_emitLoopTM`,
`Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_splitSolveWith`,
`Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_unaryToken`,
`Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_appendBit`), two real transformers
(`emitAction`, `emitCfg`), two pure vocabulary definitions
(`solveSplitWith`, `unaryTokenSplit`). Convention's module-docstring
vocabulary bullets extend at fill time (append-only).

## 11b. Round-2 repairs (2026-10-05, after `audits/emitter-infra-findings.md`)

Round 1: **0 blockers, 2 majors, 3 minors** — no false statement among
the five contracts; both majors are adequacy obligations, repaired here.

1. **The clean-call bridge (finding 1, major).** A function-level
   contract cannot deliver the loop seam: a witness may dirty scratch or
   leave heads displaced on its final transition and still compute `f`
   within `T`. Two new sorried bridge contracts supply the
   prepared-input/clean-return interface, both with canonical
   `Cfg.ofWords`/`stateWord` entry **and** exit seams, first-positive-
   visit discipline, and envelopes charged to `T + |arg| + |f arg| + 1`:
   `Turing.FinTM.exists_installCallTM` (result installed as the
   tape-resident word, nothing emitted) and
   `Turing.FinTM.exists_emitCallTM` (argument preserved, the computed
   chunk forwarded to physical output). Both live in `Loop.lean` beside
   the seams they serve (`stateWord` is defined there). Fill route: the
   A-continuation's proved log/undo pattern around the capture wrapper,
   with virtual-input preparation from the tape-resident argument.
   `emitCfg`'s docstring now states explicitly that it does not
   normalize terminal configurations — the bridges do.
2. **The 3B normalization mapping (finding 1, required resolution).**
   The reported `satRedTM` is **not** the promised instantiation as it
   stands (its permanent position-−1 marker contradicts the blank
   `ofWords` seam; its raw head positions cannot cross seams). The
   committed instantiation plan: loop state word encodes
   `(cursor, consumed-prefix length, phase tag)` via the audited pairing
   vocabulary — the raw streaming position is re-derived each round by
   advancing past the consumed prefix, and **the permanent marker is
   eliminated** (round-local buffering restores its tape by round end).
   Per round: decode the state word; `exists_installCallTM` over
   `computesFunInTime_unaryToken` reads the next token of the remaining
   serialization; finite control classifies marker/polarity bits; the
   emitted clause fragment goes out through `exists_emitCallTM` (chunks
   are of token-bounded length) or directly by finite control for
   fixed fragments; the fresh-variable counter updates through
   `computesFunInTime_appendBit` + install. Rounds have positive
   duration and input-length-only budget; `R` = the serialized input
   length (each round consumes at least one input position); once the
   formula terminator is consumed, an **absorbing finished phase emits
   empty chunks** for all remaining rounds. Token output is decoded by
   `pairDecode`-side vocabulary (proved); append output becomes the
   next state word by the install call. The banked `satReduction_*`
   semantics close the function identity; `satRed_start`'s proved
   maximum-pass survives as the `s0` computation.
3. **The 4A stage mapping (finding 2, required resolution — recorded
   here, certified against the attached phase-4 records in round 2).**
   All-string validation runs **before any irreversible emission**: the
   validation stages run as a decision prefix (the audited conditional
   W3 over the parser/boundary checks); only the valid branch enters
   the emitting loop, and the invalid branch emits the fixed fallback
   through finite control. Logical round count: `R` = the
   snapshot-index bound of the six-stage contract (an input-length-only
   polynomial), one clause group per round through `exists_emitCallTM`;
   the exact serialization-length ledger is the sum of the per-round
   chunk lengths — never constant-per-clause, exactly as the phase-4
   ledger demands. Serialization terminators: the final terminator is
   the last round's chunk tail (or a post-loop constant emission by
   finite control); both options keep the concatenation exact.
4. **Host routing correction (finding 3, minor).**
   `exists_emitLoopTM`'s construction sketch now specifies the
   **forwarding host variant** (body dispatched through `emitAction`;
   fuel/countdown machinery reused; contracts proved over
   arbitrary-accumulated-output configurations; a **new**
   prefix-summation lemma modeled on `loop_run`) — the unchanged
   find-mode host is refuted by the auditor's one-state witness, since
   `captureAction` suppresses the body's physical output.
5. **Token conventions (finding 4, minor).** `unaryTokenSplit`'s
   docstring now states it consumes unary tokens only, with the
   auditor's separating example; standalone markers and polarity bits
   are scanner grammar states.
6. **P17's actual rule (finding 1's visibility note).** Fixed
   finite-control chunks are emitted directly by body control (no
   primitive, no appeal to the private `constTM`); unbounded
   tape-dependent chunks go through `exists_emitCallTM`. §11a item 1 is
   corrected accordingly: the subsumption's discharging rule is body
   finite control, or the emit call, never the private constant
   machine.
7. **Documentation (finding 5, minor).** The four definitions now carry
   customers and construction notes; attestation 4's "every new
   declaration" claim is restated in the round-2 pack as exactly what
   each class of declaration carries.

Spec surface after round 2: **seven sorried contracts** (round 1's five
plus the two bridges), two transformers, two vocabulary definitions.

## 11c. Round-3 repairs (2026-10-05, after `audits/emitter-infra-r2-findings.md`)

Round 2: **0 blockers, 2 majors, 1 minor** — round-1 findings 3–5 closed;
the bridge construction and the 3B normalization validated (r2 findings
4–5, including a 5,908-case finite corroboration of the normalized
schedule); the two cumulative majors repaired here.

1. **Positive tape count on both bridges (r2 finding 1, major).** At
   `C.k = 0`, `stateWord 0 a = stateWord 0 b` by empty domain, so the
   install conclusion was satisfiable by a two-state zero-tape machine
   for an arbitrary — even noncomputable — `f`: vacuous as a data
   interface. Both conclusions now carry `0 < C.k`, making the seam
   equality yield the genuine `bufferTape` content at index zero. The
   auditor's r2 finding 4 confirms the log/undo construction delivers
   the strengthened interface at the stated envelope.
2. **The 4A mapping rewritten (r2 finding 2, major) — this supersedes
   §11b item 3 in full.** §11b item 3 wrongly substituted parser
   validation for Cook–Levin's silent preparation stages: the 4A source
   is an arbitrary `NP` language, every binary word is a legitimate
   instance, and there is no CNF well-formedness condition on `x` (the
   auditor's empty-language witness: validation-plus-fallback would
   emit the satisfiable `serialize [] = [false]` for a no-instance).
   Parse-before-emission belongs to the 3B/4B decode-based transducers
   only. The corrected stage-to-seam mapping:
   - **Silent preparation (inherited stages s1–s5).** A silent startup
     phase computes and packs the preparation records into `s0 x`:
     exact `Q(n)`, `m = n + Q(n)`, and the horizon `T` (s1, exact
     arithmetic, certificate length never enlarged); the virtual
     reference input `false^m` with clamped virtual head, source
     writes/moves executed on the halting transition, source output
     suppressed and halt internalized (s2–s3, through the capture and
     install-call interfaces at positive tape count); the inclusive
     trajectory records for **all** times `0..T` with administrative
     transitions outside simulated time and frozen positions after an
     early halt (s4); greatest-strictly-earlier-visit records with
     sequential comparison costs (s5). All of s1–s5 end with empty
     physical output and the packed records as the clean persistent
     word — the emitting loop's `s0`.
   - **Ordered emission (s6).** One **family member per round**, the
     cursor walking the fixed family order of the phase-4 contract.
     With `T + 1` snapshot times and `k` work tapes, the six families
     have `n, 1, T, T+1, k(T+1), T` members; the round count is their
     sum: `R = n + (k+3)·T + k + 1` (an input-length-only polynomial).
     Rounds with empty template output still take positive time. The
     single final formula terminator is appended to the last round's
     chunk. The serialization-length ledger is the exact sum
     `1 + 2·#clauses + Σ (v+3)` over literal occurrences — total
     output `O_M(T²)`, never constant-per-clause.
   - The alternative `R = T` time-major grouping is **not** adopted:
     it would need a separate proof that its interleaving reserializes
     to the fixed family order.
   Certification of this mapping against the phase-4 round-2
   boundary-check table is round 3's business — that table
   (`audits/ch2-phase4-reaudit-findings.md`) rides in the r3 bundle,
   and the 4A brief inherits it verbatim per the standing rule.
3. **P17 cross-reference (r2 finding 3, minor).** §11a item 1 now
   carries an explicit supersession marker pointing at §11b item 6;
   the historical text is preserved as history.
4. **Provenance upgrades for round 3.** The log/undo fill route now has
   fresh in-repo provenance beyond the epoch-2 enumerator: the
   A-continuation checkpoint (integrated 2026-10-05) banked exactly the
   track/clear/compare phase family the r2 finding-4 construction
   describes (`e3cTrackTM`/`e3c_track_run`/`e3cClearTM`/`e3c_clear_run`
   — logged simulation over a visited interval with origin markers,
   exact single-triple cleanup at `6T+7`, positive first returns), as
   proved privates in `Nondeterminism.lean`; its REPORT and source ride
   in the r3 bundle.

Spec surface after round 3: unchanged in count — **seven sorried
contracts** (the two bridges now carrying `0 < C.k`), two transformers,
two vocabulary definitions.

## 11d. Gate close (2026-10-05, after `audits/emitter-infra-r3-findings.md`)

Round 3: **0 blockers, 0 majors, 1 minor, 4 notes — GATE CLOSED**
(`audits/emitter-infra-resolutions.md`). Both cumulative majors
discharged: the positive-tape bridges export the data interface (the
auditor's projection-table derivation), and §11c's 4A mapping is
certified against the inherited boundary table, including the exact
per-member chunk rule. The minor — swept in the closing commit — was an
attribution error of §11b item 1/§11c item 4 and the install-call
sketch: the A-continuation's delivered provenance is
**visited-interval tracking and clearing** (`e3cTrackTM`/`e3cClearTM`),
not an overwritten-symbol history/undo implementation; at a clean
entry seam, clearing is restoring, so the track/clear route fills the
bridges directly, and history/undo stands only as the independently
derived alternative (r2 finding 4). Two clarifications from r3
finding 3 bind the 4A brief: `R = n+(k+3)T+k+1` is the last round
index (member count `R + 1`), and the chunk rule emits per-member
flatMaps with the single terminator on the last chunk only. Fill
batches proceed under the resolutions' binding section, partitioned
Loop / Primitives / Wrappers.

## 12. The routine layer (proposed 2026-10-08, pre-ch3/4 campaign)

**Mandate** (user decisions 2026-10-06 and 2026-10-08, recorded in `backlog.md` §2
and `AroraBarakChapters3-4Plan.md` §4a/§8): built after the Chapter-2 closure and
**before the chapter-3/4 fill epochs**, in parallel with their statement phases;
scoped to **amply support the chapter-1/2 retrofit**, not merely the new
consumers; and — superseding §1's "no space bounds" non-goal for this increment —
**every item below carries a space clause alongside its time cost**, so that the
chapter-4 campaign and the P4.x statements consume the layer without a second
pass. The space measure is the house one: `Turing.MultiTapeTM.spaceUsed`
(work-tape cells visited; input and output tapes excluded).

**Evidence.** The 4A chain is the measurement: roughly half of the A2/A3
deliveries' 202 native privates are hand-rebuilt bank/relocation/dispatch
routines; the `emitterBank*`/`emitterP2*` relocation family was privately
re-harvested three times; and A3's proved costs (`3|w| + 3` copy, `2|w| + 2`
clear) match the external prior art's `3w + 2`/`2w + 2` to within one step —
independent convergence on the same catalog, discovered in the 2026-10-06
survey. The emitter round-1 finding stands: *function-level* contracts cannot
deliver clean-return seams, so the gap is configuration-level. §5 deferred the
general tape-embedding transformation "until a third site needs it"; the third,
fourth, and fifth sites have now arrived (the retrofit families, the
Hennie-Stearns conversion, the two-work-tape universal machine).

**What already exists and is consumed, not duplicated** (colleague modules,
Hydroxyi/Jason Dong, on `main` since `f70c57c2`): the *function-level half* —
`TuringMachine/CounterProg{,Run}.lean` (goto programs over unary registers
compiled once into `FinTM`, `t` abstract steps within `t(2t+3)` machine steps,
FP bridge via `ClassNP/CounterProgPolyTime.lean`), `ClassNP/Transducer.lean`,
`ClassNP/{PolyTimePairing,PClosure}.lean`, `TuringMachine/UnaryTape.lean`; and,
on the space side, `SpaceComplexity/Machines/` (the `LogProg` register-program
compiler with `compile_space`/`arm_decides`). §12 supplies the
configuration-level half those layers sit on.

### R1. Bank embedding (the §5 deferral, promoted)

A verified routine on its own `m`-tape set runs on any injectively selected
subset of a `k`-tape host's work tapes, cost unchanged, everything else framed.
Spec shape (final quantifiers fixed at spec time, audited): for an embedding
`ι : Fin m ↪ Fin k`, transported actions and configurations with

* **lockstep** — transported `runFrom` commutes with the source `runFrom`;
* **frame** — tapes outside `range ι` are byte-identical before and after, their
  heads unmoved; input position tracks the source; emission policy is a
  parameter (suppressed or forwarded — the W1/E2 pair fixes the two modes;
  whether this is one transformer with a mode or two transformers is open
  decision 12.4);
* **time** — step count preserved exactly;
* **space** — cells visited on host tape `ι i` equal cells visited on source
  tape `i`; unselected tapes visit nothing new.

Generic form of: `emitterBank*`, the `emitterP2*` relocation family,
`clBank*`/`clSlot*` (4A chain), and their chapter-1 analogues in
`Build/Primitives.lean`/`Build/Loop.lean` internals.

### R2. Seam composition

Sequential composition of two controllers at a canonical `Turing.Cfg.ofWords`
seam (Convention.lean's ABI notion): if `M₁` carries seam `c₀` to seam `c₁`
within `T₁` under a first-return cut, and `M₂` carries `c₁` to `c₂` within
`T₂`, the dispatch-glued machine carries `c₀` to `c₂` within `T₁ + T₂ + O(1)`,
with the glue state-sum and dispatch lemmas owned by the combinator. Space
clause: visited sets union, so per-tape space is bounded by the sum of the
parts' per-tape spaces (whether the spec states the sharper per-tape `max` for
disjointly-owned tapes is open decision 12.1). Generic form of the per-batch
dispatch gluing re-proved in every A-chain and emitter batch.

### R3. Catalog promotion, with space costs

Promotion of the remaining audited A-chain privates as public machines with
exact time *and* space costs: transfer (word from tape `i` to tape `j`,
`3|w| + 3`), copy (`3|w| + 3`), clear (`2m + 2`, = P12's engine), compare, and
increment — D6-style promotion, not new proof work, seeded from the named
private families. Additionally, the existing catalog rows (P1-P12, P16-P18)
and the W/L/E combinators are **retro-annotated with space theorems** — new
`spaceUsed` lemmas beside the existing specs, no signature changes, so the
audited statement surface is untouched (additive growth; open decision 12.3 on
doing this here versus lazily per consumer — the amply-support mandate argues
for here).

### Consumers (rule-of-admission check, §4: two named customers per item)

| Consumer | Uses |
|---|---|
| Chapter-1/2 retrofit (backlog §2) | R1 for the bank/relocation families; R2 for the dispatch families; R3 for `clCopy*`/`clCmp*`/`clRead*`/`clCount*` and the `Build/` harvest families |
| Hennie-Stearns `k`→2 conversion ([AB09] §1.7; ch3-4 plan §2.1) | zones as banks (R1), shifts as R3 transfers, seam discipline (R2); the amortization is mathematics on top |
| Two-work-tape universal machine (ch3-4 plan §2.1, §4a) | R1 + R2 throughout; the retrofit pilot; candidate space-bounded variant feeding Thm 4.8 / Ex 4.1 |
| Chapter-4 ARM extensions (ch3-4 plan §2.5: nondeterministic and polynomial-width variants of `LogProg`) | R1/R2 at their `FinTM` compilation boundary; R3 space rows |

### Placement, sequencing, cost

* New files `Build/Embed.lean` (R1) and `Build/Seam.lean` (R2); R3's new rows in
  a new `Build/Catalog.lean` (`Primitives.lean` is already over the size policy;
  final name is open decision 12.2, settled before the spec audit per §9.6).
  Namespace `Turing.FinTM`; order list after `Build/Loop`.
* Process per `workflow.md`: maintainer-serial spec layer (quantifier-sensitive,
  as §10), statement gate, fills as harvest-adaptation batches, fill audit. The
  gate must close before the first chapter-3/4 fill epoch (plan §4a); statement
  phases of chapters 3-4 run in parallel.
* Estimate (campaign points): R1 spec+fill ≈ 10 (the lockstep is the risk
  concentration, L-style), R2 ≈ 8, R3 promotions + space retro-annotation ≈ 12,
  serial spec layer ≈ 6. Total ≈ 36, one mid-size batch equivalent.

### Open decisions (human review; audit verifies, never disposes)

* **12.1** R2 space accounting — **answered (user, 2026-10-08): the sharper
  form.** The spec states per-tape bounds, with the max for disjointly-owned
  tapes (sharpest available; downstream applications may depend on the
  sharpness).
* **12.2** R3's file layout — **answered (user, 2026-10-08): option (a)**, a
  new `Build/Catalog.lean` holding the new rows and the space lemmas for the
  old rows, keeping `Primitives.lean` byte-identical; a backlog item records
  the later refactor toward the symmetrical per-theme layout (option (c)),
  via the D7 split window.
* **12.3** Space retro-annotation — **answered (user, 2026-10-08): the refined
  now-option**: the primitives as realized (P1-P15), wrappers (W1-W3) and the
  loop (L) get `spaceUsed` theorems in this increment; the emitter combinators
  (E1-E4′) stay lazy until a space consumer appears, **and the E3′ stream rows
  P16-P18 ride with that lazy scope** (their only consumers are the emitters —
  scope clarification recorded at skeleton time, 2026-10-08, flagged to the
  §12 statement-gate audit and reversible there if the gate reads the
  original "P1-P18" wording as binding).
* **12.4** R1 emission policy — **answered (user, 2026-10-08): two named
  transformers** (suppressing and forwarding) over a shared private core, so
  each spec stays crisp and downstream applications cite whichever fits.

### Citations (policy.md §2, *Design adaptation*)

The configuration-level design is adapted from — with nothing transcribed —
**Édouard Bonnet's `classical-complexity`** (Lax Archive lax-434930), module
`proofs/Lax434930Proofs/InclusionAux/TimeCompiler/`: `StackProgram`'s
`compile_correct`, `StackRename`'s `rename_executes`/`executes_in_sum` (the
bank-embedding and seam-composition shapes), and the
transfer/clear/copy/for/repeat routine catalog; commit
`0c0840319318215fd7b36a9a822b81ce55cf6941`, Apache-2.0; examined 2026-10-05,
different toolchain (Lean 4.33 vs our 4.25) and machine model (TM2-style keyed
stacks vs `FinTM` tapes with heads). Suggested tag: `[Bon26]`. The R-modules'
docstrings and their blueprint entries must carry this citation, alongside the
existing `[Balbach22]` (AFP `Cook_Levin`) for the composition architecture and
the in-repo credits to the colleague modules named above.

### 12.5 Round-1 audit repairs (2026-10-09)

The §12 statement-gate round 1 (`audits/routine-infra-findings.md`: 0
blockers, 4 majors) drove four repairs, landed with the round-2 pack:

* **R1 → the returning embeddings** `embedSilentRetTM`/`embedEmitRetTM`
  (states `S ⊕ Unit`): the closed transformers lose a final halting
  emission to either the halt or a premature seam dispatch — the audit's
  formal trace. The returning flavors execute every source action through
  the halting transition and land in the live anchor `Sum.inr ()`.
* **R2 → general-configuration seam composition**
  (`seamCompTM_run_ofCfg` + first-return and visited forms): the canonical
  `Cfg.ofWords` theorems cannot consume arbitrary frames, displaced
  inactive heads, or accumulated output; the general form starts phase two
  from phase one's returned configuration with only the control state
  replaced.
* **R3 → the fresh-entry/release adapter** `seamReleaseTM`: positive
  calls returning to their own anchor are now seam-consumable (the entry
  action executes unconditionally from a fresh start state).
* **R4 → the threaded-map witness** is re-commissioned as a forwarding
  controller (validate/buffer, emit prefix, forward payload output);
  the received captured-payload machine is refuted as a witness for the
  linear-administration bound.

Scope notes R9 (physical-tape selection is not zone multiplexing) and R10
(loop sibling contracts not exported) are recorded at their definition
sites.

## 13. The zone and virtual-input layer (proposed 2026-10-09, post-§12 close)

**Mandate** (user direction 2026-10-09, at the §12 fill-campaign close —
track A of the two parallel tracks, the other being the chapter-1/2
retrofit): the §12 scope note **R9 promoted**. R9 drew the line at
physical-tape selection — `ι` relocates whole tapes and "the Hennie-Stearns
and universal-machine consumers get their zone/virtual-input representation
layers separately" (`Build/Embed.lean` header). This increment is that
separate layer. It gates the two stage-1 builds (the Hennie-Stearns `k`→2
conversion and the two-work-tape universal machine, plan §2.1/§4b) and is
scoped, like §12, beyond its first consumers: the virtual-input half serves
the `NP^EXPCOM ⊆ EXP` summit and the 12.2c dedup, and the zone half is
shaped so the chapter-1 Robustness conversions can gain **space theorems
additively** (plan §2.7's fallback route to Ex 4.1/Thm 4.8). §12's space
mandate continues: **every item carries a space clause alongside its time
cost** (`Turing.MultiTapeTM.spaceUsed`, work tapes only).

**Evidence.** The virtual-input pattern has now been hand-built four times
over the proved corpus: the A2 forwarding controller's
`a2_mapVirtual`/`a2_mapVirtual_step`/`a2_mapVirtual_run` lockstep (15 of
its 45 privates; both boundary clamps, empty-word case, halt absorption —
all proved), F2A's `f2_splitCountAction`/`f2_splitCount_run`
(virtual *empty* input over preinstalled banks), the universal
interpreter's prefix-input discipline, and the oblivious candidate's
`obliviousVisit` virtual-tape transduction. All four sit on the same public
primitive — `virtualMove`/`VirtualTag`/`virtualNextTag` and
`bufferTape_inputSymbol` (`Simulation.lean`) — and each rebuilt the hosting
and lockstep privately. On the zone side, the in-repo precedents are the
`SingleTape.lean` multiplexing encoding (`SweepCell`/`tapeRow`) and
`ObliviousSetup.lean`'s guide-zone layout with its two-directional run
identities; what does not exist anywhere is a *reusable* zoned carrier with
shift routines. The F2 epoch audit's three optional regression corollaries
(zero-time startup, both virtual-input clamps, setup followed by an
emitting halting step) are adopted here as permanent lemmas of Z1.

**What already exists and is consumed, not duplicated**: the §12 layer
itself (R1/R2 and the catalog rows are the assembly language of every
construction below); `virtualMove`/`VirtualTag` (`Simulation.lean`);
`Turing.actionBits₂` and the `CodeNDTM` two-work-tape serialization
(`NDCodes.lean`, statement-frozen under the closed P3.3 gate) — Z3 builds
the deterministic sibling against the same record format, never a second
serialization; `UnaryTape.lean`; the harvest policy of §8 (reimplement
against the ABI with the original proof as template; audited originals stay
in place until the separately-tracked retrofit/12.2c dedup).

### Z1. Virtual-input hosting (the `a2_mapVirtual` pattern, promoted)

A transformer hosting a machine whose input is a **designated buffered
word** rather than the native input: given a host with an injective tape
selection (R1's `ι`) plus one buffer tape holding `y`, the hosted machine
runs with `y` as its virtual input, buffer head at
`source.inputPos - 1` under a `VirtualTag` boundary discipline. Spec shape:

* **lockstep** — one host step per source step, transported `runFrom`
  identity (the A2 `a2_mapVirtual_run` shape, generalized from its
  two-buffer controller to the R1 selection);
* **clamps** — both boundary clamps hold with **no nonempty-`y` premise**
  (empty `y`: position `0` is the right boundary, `-1` the left; outward
  moves stay, inward moves cross) — the binding A2/F2 audit contract;
* **halt absorption** — the source's halting action executes before the
  host control dies; later times are fixed;
* **emission policy** — suppressed or forwarded, mirroring R1's two modes
  (open decision 12.4 resolves both at once);
* **time** — exact; **space** — coefficient-one containment: each selected
  tape's host visited set is contained in the source's visited set on `y`
  at the same horizon (the R4 ledger shape, proved in `a2_map_space`).

Permanent regression lemmas (audit-adopted): the zero-time startup
instance, the two empty-`y` clamp instances, and the setup-then-emitting-
halt seam. Generic form of: `a2_mapVirtual*` (A2), `f2_splitCount*` (F2A,
the `y = []` specialization), the universal interpreter's input phase, and
the query simulation every oracle-summit machine will need.

**Z1 rider — the R1 selected-tape exports (decision D-R1, user
2026-10-09, from the retrofit inventories, plan §4d).** The three retrofit
inventories independently identified the same R1 API gap: `Embed.lean`
exports no selected-tape field lemmas (`embedSlot_selected`/`_unselected`
are private) and no agreeing-host lockstep, so no old-code R1 consumer can
be proved from the public surface. This statement phase adds, **additively
in `Embed.lean`** (shared-file mechanism, audited under this gate): public
selected-tape projections of `embedSilentCfg`/`embedEmitCfg` (contents and
head of tape `ι i`), and an `ofWords` transport form. Unlocks the blocked
Hardness families (M/N/AM/U, Z/AB/AG — ≈ 300-350 lines) at the next
retrofit window.

### Z5. Machine-agreement transfer (decision D-R3, user 2026-10-09)

A general lockstep-transfer lemma, the `hagree` genre of
`capture_run`/`emit_run` made standalone: two machines over the same tape
count and state type whose transition tables **agree on a set of states**
run identically, configuration for configuration, from agreeing starts for
as long as the run stays inside the agreement set; a guarded variant takes
the agreement hypothesis per reachable state. Natural home:
`Simulation.lean` beside the existing lockstep gadgets (placement open
decision 13.5: Simulation versus a `Build/` module). Customers (rule of
admission): the Loop forwarding host (H3's 14 verbatim re-proved phase
lemmas, ≈ 550 lines, collapse to one transfer — `emLoopHost` agrees with
`loopHost` on every non-body state); the 13 guarded `clSlot_run` agreement
sites in `CookLevin/Hardness.lean`; every future mode-variant host (the
§12 loop hosts' decision/find/emit triplet is exactly this pattern).
Estimate: ≈ 4 points spec + fill; the risk is quantifier placement on the
agreement set, not proof content.

### Z2. Zoned tape carrier (the Hennie-Stearns representation)

The representation of `m` virtual work tapes on **one** physical tape with
amortizable locality: a `ZoneLayout` (level count `ℓ`; per-level zones
`L_i`/`R_i` of capacity `2^i` around a home origin, [AB09] §1.7) and a
carrier predicate `ZoneCfg` relating one physical word to `m` virtual words
plus per-zone fullness states (empty / half / full). The layer owns:

* **the carrier** — `ZoneCfg` well-formedness, read/write-at-home
  contracts (the virtual heads always sit at the physical origin), and the
  cell-encoding convention (open decision 13.2: how `Option Bool` virtual
  cells embed into binary physical cells — paired-cell presence/data
  tracks, with `SingleTape.lean`'s `SweepCell` encoding as the precedent);
* **the shift routines** — per-level `shiftIn`/`shiftOut` rebalancing
  rows with **exact** costs `O(2^i)`, assembled from R3
  transfer/copy/clear via R2 seams, each with its space row (visited cells
  within the touched zones);
* **the cardinality lemmas** — visited-set bookkeeping for multiplexed
  tapes: physical space bounded by the sum of touched zone extents, the
  piece the Robustness space annotation (Z4) consumes.

Explicitly **on top, not inside**: the `2^i`-fullness invariant across a
run, the amortized `O(T log T)` charge, and the simulation theorem itself —
those are the Hennie-Stearns consumer's mathematics (plan §2.1), as the
§12 precedent kept the loop ledgers out of the loop host. Scope note:
Z2 is sized for the H-S discipline (one zoned tape + one scratch tape);
a general `k`→`k'` conversion is not in scope.

### Z3. Two-work-tape codes (the deterministic `actionBits₂` sibling)

The deterministic code layer currently covers only the one-work-tape
binary normal form (`EffectiveMachineCode`/`UniformMachineCode`,
`Encoding.lean`), which is why Thm 3.1 arrives at `f²` (plan §2.1). Z3
extends it: a deterministic two-work-tape code scheme over the
**same `actionBits₂` record format** as `CodeNDTM` (one branch instead of
two), with the `CodeParser` extension and the `UniformMachineCode`-style
uniform-decoding clause (the P3.2 lesson: variable-code consumers need the
uniformly-timed form). The two-work-tape **universal machine itself** is
the stage-1 consumer build, not part of this layer; Z3 ships the codes it
reads. Space rows on the parser rows from the start.

### Z4. Space annotation for the Robustness conversions (consumer-driven)

Additive `spaceUsed` theorems for the chapter-1 conversions
(`one_work_tape`, the alphabet reduction) via Z2's cardinality lemmas — no
signature changes, the audited surface untouched (the R3 retro-annotation
precedent). This is plan §2.7's fallback route to the space-efficient
universal (Ex 4.1, Thm 4.8). **Design-time obligation, recorded here**: at
the Z1-Z3 spec phase, assess whether the two-work-tape universal carrying
Z1/Z2 space rows yields Ex 4.1 directly; the answer (and hence whether Z4
is needed at all, and at which strength) is recorded before the statement
gate, so the chapter-4 risk register (§6 summit 1) is settled either way.

### Consumers (rule-of-admission check, §4: two named customers per item)

| Item | Customers |
|---|---|
| Z1 virtual-input hosting | the two-work-tape universal (stage 1); the `NP^EXPCOM ⊆ EXP` summit's query simulation; the 12.2c dedup of `a2_mapVirtual*`/`f2_splitCount*`; the P3.3 universal-NDTM fill's code/input discipline |
| Z2 zoned carrier + shifts | the Hennie-Stearns `k`→2 conversion (plan §2.1); the Robustness space annotation (Z4); the Ex 1.6 oblivious sharpening (recorded stretch goal, `Robustness/Oblivious.lean`) |
| Z3 two-work-tape codes | the two-work-tape universal; the Thm 3.1 re-derivation at `f log f` (Hydroxyi's diagonal argument over the new codes) |
| Z4 space annotation | Thm 4.8/Ex 4.1 fallback (plan §2.7); `L ⊊ PSPACE`/space-hierarchy fills (P4.3) if the universal route stalls |

### Placement, sequencing, cost

* New files `Build/VirtualInput.lean` (Z1) and `Build/Zone.lean` (Z2),
  namespace `Turing.FinTM`, order list after `Build/Catalog`; Z3 as a new
  `TuringMachine/Codes2.lean` beside `Encoding.lean` (placement open
  decision 13.3: a new file versus extending `Encoding.lean` — the frozen
  audited surface of `Encoding.lean` argues for the new file); Z4 lands
  additively in the `Robustness/` files through the shared-file mechanism,
  flagged for its own audit.
* Process per `workflow.md`, the §12 precedent verbatim: maintainer-serial
  spec layer (quantifier-sensitive), statement gate by external audit,
  fills as briefed batches with exclusive ownership, epoch-boundary fill
  audit. The gate must close before the H-S/two-tape-universal builds
  start; chapter-3/4 fill briefs written while this layer is open simply
  do not cite it (the EXPCOM brief prefers Z1 only if Z1 is closed).
* Estimate (campaign points): Z1 ≈ 8 (harvest-grade — the lockstep is
  proved four times over; the risk is quantifier hygiene, not proof
  content), Z2 ≈ 14 (genuinely new; the carrier predicate is the risk
  concentration, L-style), Z3 ≈ 6 (format fixed by `actionBits₂`), Z4 ≈ 6
  (retro-annotation against Z2's lemmas). Total ≈ 34, between the §12
  statement layer and one fill epoch.
* **Citation duty** (binding, the 2026-10-06 guideline and the 2026-10-08
  citation-audit row): the design adapts [AB09] §1.7 (Hennie-Stearns) and
  Exercise 1.5/1.6; the §12 duty extends here — Édouard Bonnet's
  lax-434930 `classical-complexity` (Apache-2.0, commit `0c084031…`) is
  cited in this addendum, the module docstrings, and the blueprint entries
  wherever its stack-machine routine catalog informed a row's shape; no
  external code is imported or transcribed.

### Open decisions (13.x, for the user at spec time)

1. **13.1 Zone discipline**: zones-with-fullness (the [AB09] §1.7 layout,
   proposed) versus plain interleaving (simpler carrier, no amortized
   locality — insufficient for H-S alone, but cheaper if Z2's only
   customer were Z4). Proposed: zones; interleaving is not built.
2. **13.2 Cell encoding**: how `Option Bool` virtual cells embed in binary
   physical cells (paired presence/data cells proposed; `SweepCell` as
   precedent).
3. **13.3 Z3 placement**: new `Codes2.lean` (proposed) versus extending
   the frozen `Encoding.lean`.
4. **13.4 Z1 mode shape**: one transformer with an emission-mode parameter
   versus two transformers — inherits open decision 12.4's resolution.
5. **13.5 Z5 placement**: the agreement-transfer lemma in `Simulation.lean`
   beside the lockstep gadgets (proposed) versus a `Build/` module.

### 13a. Decisions resolved; epoch structure (user, 2026-10-09)

All five open decisions resolved as proposed, with one rename:
**13.1** zones-with-fullness (interleaving is not built); **13.2** paired
presence/data cells (`SweepCell` precedent); **13.3** a new file, renamed
**`TuringMachine/Codes2Tape.lean`** so the "2" reads as *two-tape*;
**13.4** Z1 inherits 12.4's resolution (a silent/emit transformer pair over
one shared core); **13.5** Z5 lands in `Simulation.lean`.

**The statement phase runs in two tranches, each with its own gate:**

* **A-S1 — the virtual-input half**: Z5 (the agreement transfer,
  `Simulation.lean`, additive), Z1 (`Build/VirtualInput.lean`, new), and
  the Z1 rider (the R1 selected-tape exports, `Embed.lean`, additive via
  the shared-file mechanism). Rationale: harvest-grade risk (the lockstep
  is proved four times over; the rider's facts are proved privately), and
  its consumers are the *near-term* ones — the blocked retrofit R1
  families, the 12.2c dedup, the Loop H3 collapse, the EXPCOM summit.
* **A-S2 — the zone half**: Z2 (`Build/Zone.lean`), Z3
  (`Codes2Tape.lean`), Z4 (the Robustness space annotation). Rationale:
  Z2's carrier predicate is the genuine design risk and deserves an
  undiluted gate; its consumers (Hennie-Stearns, the two-tape universal)
  sit one stage later. The Z4 design-time obligation (does the two-tape
  universal's space bonus yield Ex 4.1?) is discharged in the A-S2 pack.

The canonical Z1 shape (spec-time refinement, recorded before drafting):
the transformer is defined on exactly `1 + M.k` work tapes — the buffer
first, the payload bank after it — and **relocation is not baked in**:
a consumer needing the buffer or bank elsewhere composes with R1. One
shared hosting core; `silent`/`emit` flavors per 12.4; the tag lives in
the transported control state (the `a2_MapState.run q tag` precedent).

# Machine-construction library: virtual-input hosting (Z1)

The virtual-input layer of the machine-construction library
(`machine-library-design.md` §13, Z1): a verified machine whose *input* is
a designated **buffered word** on a work tape runs inside a host, one host
step per source step, with the buffer read-only, the source's work bank
intact, and the source's input movement realized as the clamped buffer
movement of `Turing.FinTM.virtualMove` under the `VirtualTag` boundary
discipline. This is the pattern the proved corpus has hand-rebuilt five
times — `Turing.FinTM.bufferedCompTM`'s second phase
(`bufferedSecondCfg_step`/`_run`, the public template for the contracts
below), the A2 forwarding controller's `a2_mapVirtual` lockstep and the
F2A `f2_splitCount*` virtual-empty-input hosting (both private in
`Build/Catalog.lean`), the universal interpreter's input discipline, and
the oblivious candidate's `obliviousVisit` transduction — promoted to one
transformer pair.

## Design (decisions 13.4 and 13a, recorded in the design document)

* **Canonical layout, relocation by composition.** The transformer is
  defined on exactly `1 + m` work tapes — the buffer first, the payload
  bank after it. A consumer needing the buffer or bank elsewhere composes
  with the R1 embeddings of `Build/Embed.lean`; relocation is never baked
  in.
* **A silent/emit pair over one core** (the 12.4 shape). The forwarding
  flavor `vhostEmitTM` passes source emissions to the host's physical
  output. The suppressing flavor `vhostSilentTM` is *defined as the layer
  composing with itself*: the R1 capture wrapper `embedSilentTM` applied
  to `vhostEmitTM` at the identity-shaped selection, with one extra
  capture tape appended — so its contracts are instances of the two
  layers' contracts, never a third lockstep.
* **The boundary tag lives in the control state** (`S × Bool`, the
  `a2_MapState.run q tag` precedent): a stationary move preserves the
  tag, so repeated outward attempts at a blank boundary stay clamped,
  with **no nonempty-input premise anywhere** — on an empty buffered word
  the two boundaries are adjacent and the clamps still hold.
* **Setup is the consumer's.** The transformer owns the hosting from a
  loaded buffer onward; parsing, loading, and rewinding the buffer, and
  choosing the seam, belong to the consumer (the A2 controller's parse
  stages are the precedent), seamed with R2.

## Status: statement skeleton (§13 statement phase, tranche A-S1)

The transformers and the configuration transport below are real
definitions; every contract is `sorry`d with a proof sketch, awaiting the
A-S1 statement gate and its fill epoch. The sketches name the proved
template each fill adapts.

## Main definitions and results

* `Turing.vhostCfg` — the configuration transport: a source configuration
  on virtual input `y`, a boundary tag, a frozen native input position,
  and a prior output prefix, viewed inside the `1 + m`-tape host.
* `Turing.vhostEmitTM` — the forwarding transformer.
* `Turing.vhostSilentTM` — the suppressing/capturing transformer, as the
  R1 capture of the forwarding flavor.
* `Turing.vhostEmitTM_runFrom` — the lockstep: one host step per source
  step, at every time, with a valid arrival tag; halted sources are
  absorbed; no halting, liveness, or nonempty-input hypotheses.
* `Turing.vhostEmitTM_visitedByTapeHead_bank` /
  `Turing.vhostEmitTM_visitedByTapeHead_buffer` — the bank tapes visit
  exactly the source's cells; the buffer head's trajectory is exactly the
  source's input trajectory shifted by one.
* `Turing.vhostEmitTM_spaceUsed_le` — the coefficient-one space ledger:
  host space is at most source space plus the buffer interval
  `y.length + 2`.
* `Turing.vhostSilentTM_runFrom` / `Turing.vhostSilentTM_spaceUsed_le` —
  the suppressing flavor's instances.
* Permanent regression lemmas (adopted from the F2 epoch audit):
  `Turing.vhostCfg_buffer_head_mem` (the clamp interval, empty word
  included) and `Turing.vhostEmitTM_emitting_halt` (a source halting
  emission is forwarded before the host control dies).

namespace Turing

variable {m : ℕ} {S : Type*} {x y : List Bool}

`1 + m` work tapes. -/

/-- The payload-bank tape of the canonical virtual-input host carrying the
source's work tape `i`. -/
def vhostBank (i : Fin m) : Fin (1 + m) := Fin.natAdd 1 i

/-- A source configuration on virtual input `y`, viewed inside the
`1 + m`-tape host over native input `x`: the control carries the source
state and the boundary tag; the native input head sits frozen at `p`; the
buffer holds `y` with its head at the source's input position minus one
(the `Turing.FinTM.bufferTape_inputSymbol` convention); the bank holds the
source's work tapes and heads verbatim; and the host output is the prior
prefix `pre` followed by everything the source has emitted. A halted
source maps to a halted host. -/

  workTapePos := Fin.addCases (fun _ => (c.inputPos.val : ℤ) - 1) c.workTapePos
  output := pre ++ c.output

/-- **Z1, the forwarding virtual-input transformer** (design §13, decision
13.4). Host the `m`-tape machine `M` on `1 + m` tapes with its input read
from the buffer: each step reads the buffer cell as the source's input
symbol, performs the source's work actions on the bank, realizes the
source's input movement as the clamped buffer movement, forwards the
source's emission physically, never moves the native input head, and
carries the arrival tag in control. The initial tag is `true` (valid at
the canonical start position `1` for every `y`, the empty word included).
Setup — loading `y` onto the buffer and arriving at a `vhostCfg` seam — is
the consumer's, by R2 composition. -/

def vhostCap (m : ℕ) : Fin ((1 + m) + 1) := Fin.natAdd (1 + m) (0 : Fin 1)

/-- **Z1, the suppressing virtual-input transformer**: the layer composing
with itself. The R1 capture wrapper runs the forwarding host on the first
`1 + m` tapes of a `(1 + m) + 1`-tape machine, records every emission on
the appended capture tape, and emits nothing physically. Its contracts are
instances of `Turing.embedSilentTM`'s over `Turing.vhostEmitTM`'s — no
third lockstep exists. -/
def vhostSilentTM (M : MultiTapeTM m Bool S) :
    MultiTapeTM ((1 + m) + 1) Bool (S × Bool) :=
  embedSilentTM (Fin.castAddEmb 1) (vhostCap m) (vhostEmitTM M)

/-- The suppressing flavor's configuration transport: the forwarding
transport (with empty inner prefix) viewed through the R1 silent transport
— capture word `capPre` followed by the source's emissions, ambient frame
nowhere (the single unselected tape is the capture tape), physical output
the untouched `out₀`. -/
def vhostSilentCfg (c : Cfg m Bool S y) (b : Bool) (p : Fin (x.length + 2))

  embedSilentCfg (Fin.castAddEmb 1) (vhostCap m) (fun _ _ => none) (fun _ => 0)
    capPre out₀ (vhostCfg c b p [])

/-- One forwarding host step simulates one source step, producing a valid
arrival tag; the statement includes the absorbing halted case and the
empty buffered word, with no liveness or nonemptiness premises.

**Proof sketch.** The template is the proved
`Turing.FinTM.bufferedSecondCfg_step`, with the first block removed and
the output prefix carried along. A halted source is fixed on both sides.
On a live state, buffer reads at the source input position minus one equal
source input reads (`bufferTape_inputSymbol`); `virtualMove_correct`
supplies the buffer-head equation and the new tag; the bank performs the
source's work actions; the emission appends to `pre ++ c.output` by
associativity; the native head and buffer contents are fixed; the
successor control carries the new tag, dying exactly when the source
halts. -/

/-- The forwarding lockstep at every time: one host step per source step,
with a valid arrival tag at the endpoint. Completed outputs are preserved
and a halted source stays absorbed; `t = 0` and the empty buffered word
are instances, not exceptions.

**Proof sketch.** Induct on `t` and chain `vhostEmitTM_step`, exactly as
`Turing.FinTM.bufferedSecondCfg_run` chains its step lemma. -/

/-- Bank tape `i` of the forwarding host visits exactly the cells the
source's tape `i` visits, at every horizon.

**Proof sketch.** Project `vhostEmitTM_runFrom` at each time
`u ≤ t` onto the head of `vhostBank i`: the transported configuration
holds the source head verbatim, so the two `Finset.image`s over
`Finset.range (t + 1)` agree pointwise. -/

/-- The buffer head's trajectory is exactly the source's input trajectory
shifted by one: at every horizon, the buffer tape's visited set is the
image of the source's input positions minus one.

**Proof sketch.** Project `vhostEmitTM_runFrom` at each `u ≤ t` onto the
buffer head, which the transport pins at the source input position minus
one. -/

permanent form of the two boundary clamps, the empty buffered word
included (there the interval is `[-1, 0]` and outward moves stay put).
Adopted as a permanent regression lemma from the F2 epoch audit.

**Proof sketch.** By `vhostEmitTM_runFrom` the buffer head at time `u` is
the source input position minus one, and input positions inhabit
`Fin (y.length + 2)`. -/

/-- The coefficient-one space ledger of the forwarding host: host space is
at most source space plus the buffer interval. No term depends on the
source's output or on the host horizon beyond the source's own space.

**Proof sketch.** Sum over the `1 + m` tapes: each bank tape's visited set
equals the source's (`vhostEmitTM_visitedByTapeHead_bank`), and the
buffer's visited set lies in the `y.length + 2`-cell interval
(`vhostCfg_buffer_head_mem`), so its cardinality is at most
`y.length + 2`. -/

dies: the emitted bit lands on the host output and the host halts in the
same step. Adopted as a permanent regression lemma from the F2 epoch audit
(the "closed embeddings lose the final halting emission" lesson, checked
here in the positive).

**Proof sketch.** Instantiate `vhostEmitTM_step` at a live `c` whose
action has `state = none` and `output = some bit`: the transported
successor is the halted source step, whose output is
`pre ++ c.output ++ [bit]` by the step identity. -/

/-- The suppressing lockstep at every time: capture records the source's
emissions after the prior capture prefix, the physical output stays
`out₀`, and the arrival tag stays valid.

**Proof sketch.** Chain the two layers: `vhostEmitTM_runFrom` transports
the source run through the forwarding host, and the R1 silent lockstep
(`embedSilentTM_runFrom`) transports the forwarding host's run through the
capture wrapper; `vhostSilentCfg` is by definition the composite
transport. No third induction is performed. -/

/-- The suppressing flavor's space ledger: source space, the buffer
interval, and the capture word — coefficient one on the source term.

**Proof sketch.** The R1 silent space clauses give the selected tapes' and
capture tape's contributions over the forwarding host's run; substitute
the forwarding ledger (`vhostEmitTM_spaceUsed_le` tape by tape) for the
selected bank, and bound the capture tape by its final word length plus
one via `bufferTape_append` growth. -/

# Simulation gadgets

Generic building blocks for machine constructions, split out of
`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Composition` at the epoch-1/epoch-2 boundary
(epoch-1 audit, findings 5 and 11, and the policy file-size standard): the
machines of the composition file, and the heavier constructions of later
epochs, are assembled from these. Everything here is public — it is shared
audited surface — and carries no finiteness assumptions beyond what each
gadget needs.

## Contents

* **Emission chains** (`Turing.FinTM.emitAction`, `emit_run`, `emit_halts`):
  states that write a fixed word to the output, one symbol per step, ignoring
  all reads, then halt.
* **Control actions** (`Turing.FinTM.controlAction`, `controlAction_apply`):
  transitions that only move the input head and change state.
* **Input-head positioning** (`Turing.FinTM.inputSymbol_at`,
  `moveInputPos_neg_val`, `rewind_scan`, `rewind_from_any`): reading at a
  position, the clamped left move, and the audited rewind-to-start procedure
  (one unconditional left move, left while reading a symbol, one right move).
* **Disjoint tape-block embeddings** (`Turing.FinTM.leftAction`/`rightAction`,
  `leftCfg`/`rightCfg`, their `apply`/`step`/`run` lemmas): run a machine on
  the left or right block of a `k + l`-tape machine, in lockstep, with the
  other block's tapes inactive. **Scope note** (epoch-1 audit, finding 11):
  these embeddings preserve the *native* input tape and pass emissions to the
  *real* output — they are not, by themselves, a buffered-composition
  simulator; buffering and virtual-input clamping need their own invariants on
  top.
* **Branch union** (`Turing.FinTM.branchTM`, `branchTM_computes`): two
  machines in disjoint tape and state blocks; the Boolean chooses only the
  initial state.
* **Optional-write normalization** (`Turing.Action.apply_workTapes`): the raw
  action-application identity for work tapes, promoted at the epoch-2/epoch-3
  boundary.
* **Buffered sequential simulator** (`Turing.FinTM.bufferedCompTM`): the
  three-block tape partition, contiguous buffer representation, virtual-input
  reads and clamping invariant, first- and second-phase run correspondence,
  and an exact `|y| + 2` rewind-and-dispatch ledger. These extend the scope of
  the native-input embeddings above without changing their statements.

/-! ### Machine-agreement transfer (§13, Z5)

Two machines over the same tape count and state type whose transition
tables agree on a set of control states run identically for as long as the
run's control stays inside that set. This is the `hagree` genre of
`Turing.capture_run`/`Turing.emit_run` made standalone: those lemmas carry
a per-state agreement hypothesis for one specific wrapper, re-proved ad hoc
at every host; the standalone form transfers whole runs between any two
agreeing tables (design `machine-library-design.md` §13, item Z5; decision
D-R3). First customers: the forwarding loop host of `Build/Loop.lean`
(whose fourteen phase lemmas are verbatim re-proofs of the capturing
host's, since the two tables agree on every non-body state) and the
guarded `clSlot_run` agreement sites of `CookLevin/Hardness.lean`. -/

namespace Turing.MultiTapeTM

/-- The two transition tables agree on every control state in `Q`: from any
such state, both machines take the identical action on identical reads.
Nothing is assumed about states outside `Q`, about `q₀`, or about
halting. -/

/-- One step transfers across an agreement: if the configuration's control
state (when live) lies in the agreement set, both machines step it to the
same configuration. Halted configurations step to themselves on both sides.

**Proof sketch.** On `c.state = none` both steps are the identity. On
`c.state = some q` with `q ∈ Q`, unfold `step`: both sides apply the same
action `M.tr q c.inputSymbol c.workTapeSymbols = N.tr q …` to `c`. -/

/-- A whole run transfers across an agreement: if every control state the
`M`-run visits strictly before time `t` lies in the agreement set, the two
runs coincide at time `t` (and hence at every earlier time, by
instantiating `t`). The endpoint itself may leave the set or halt; no
liveness is assumed, and `t = 0` is the trivial case.

**Proof sketch.** Induct on `t`. The inductive hypothesis transfers the
run at `t`; the visit hypothesis at `u = t` puts its live control in `Q`,
so `step_eq_of_agreeOn` transfers the final step. Halted intermediate
configurations step identically on both sides without the hypothesis. -/

(`machine-library-design.md` §12, R1): a verified routine on its own
`m`-tape set runs on any injectively selected subset of a `k`-tape host's
work tapes, cost unchanged, everything else framed. This is the §5
deferral promoted — the design deferred the general form "until a third
site needs it", and the third, fourth, and fifth sites have arrived (the
chapter-1/2 retrofit families, the Hennie–Stearns conversion, the
two-work-tape universal machine). **Scope, stated precisely** (round-1
note R9): `ι` selects whole distinct physical tapes with coordinates
intact — it does not multiplex several virtual tapes onto zones of one
physical tape, shrink the tape count, or alter the source input word; the
Hennie–Stearns and universal-machine consumers get their zone/virtual-input
representation layers separately, with this module supplying only the
fixed-physical-bank routine relocation. It is the generic form of the private
`emitterBank*`/`emitterP2*` relocation families of
`TCSlib.Complexity.TuringMachine.Build.Primitives`, of the 4A chain's
`clBank*`/`clSlot*` families, and of the retained-tape disciplines that
`Build/Loop.lean` and `Build/Wrappers.lean` carry internally.

**Status: statement skeleton (§12 statement phase).** The transformers and
configuration transports below are real definitions; every contract is
sorried, each with a proof sketch naming its fill obligations.

## Design

Per frozen decision 12.4 there are **two named transformers over one
shared private core** (`embedActionCore`), so each spec stays crisp and a
consumer cites whichever fits:

* `Turing.embedSilentTM` — the W1/capture flavor: the embedded routine's
  emissions are recorded on a designated host work tape `cap` outside the
  selected bank, and the host's physical output stays silent.
* `Turing.embedEmitTM` — the E2/forwarding flavor: emissions pass to the
  host's physical output verbatim.

The two **closed** transformers preserve the source state type and map
the source halt to the host halt; their lockstep is unguarded, holding at
every time with the step count preserved exactly. The round-1 audit
(finding R1) refuted the earlier claim that live-return dispatch could be
left to the seam combinator: a source whose final transition emits and
halts loses that emission either way — the closed embedding is halted
after it, and a seam exit at the sole live state dispatches *before* it.
The **returning** flavors below repair this with an explicit halt-to-live
adapter built into the action core: `Turing.embedSilentRetTM` and
`Turing.embedEmitRetTM` run the source on states `S ⊕ Unit`, execute every
source action **through the halting transition** — the final emission
included — and land in the live return anchor `Sum.inr ()`, which a seam
then consumes as its left exit (`Turing.captureAction`'s and
`Turing.emitterRightTM`'s halt-to-live discipline, now exported).
`Turing.captureAction`/`Turing.capture_run` and
`Turing.emitAction`/`Turing.emit_run` are the fixed-shape precursors
(last-tape capture, identity selection); their statements are untouched.

## Main definitions

* `Turing.embedSilentCfg`, `Turing.embedEmitCfg` — a source configuration
  transported along `ι : Fin m ↪ Fin k`, with the unselected host tapes
  carried as frame parameters.
* `Turing.embedSilentTM`, `Turing.embedEmitTM` — the two closed machine
  transformers.
* `Turing.embedSilentRetTM`, `Turing.embedEmitRetTM` — the two returning
  transformers (round-1 repair R1): source halts land in the live return
  anchor `Sum.inr ()`, with the halting transition executed in full.

## Main results

All sorried (statement phase):

* `Turing.embedSilentTM_runFrom`, `Turing.embedEmitTM_runFrom` — lockstep:
  the transported run is the transport of the source run, same step count.
* `Turing.embedSilentTM_frame`, `Turing.embedEmitTM_frame` — tapes outside
  `Set.range ι` byte-identical with heads unmoved, input position tracking
  the source, output per flavor.
* `Turing.embedSilentTM_visitedByTapeHead`,
  `Turing.embedEmitTM_visitedByTapeHead` (and `_frame` companions),
  `Turing.embedSilentTM_spaceUsedByTape_cap` — per-tape space: host tape
  `ι i` visits exactly the source's tape-`i` cells, unselected tapes visit
  nothing new, and the capture tape is bounded by the recorded output.
* `Turing.embedSilentRetTM_run`, `Turing.embedEmitRetTM_run` — the
  through-halt contracts: live lockstep, then the handover at the source's
  first halt, final emission and source residue preserved, with the return
  anchor reached first exactly there.
* `Turing.embedSilentRetTM_visitedByTapeHead`,
  `Turing.embedEmitRetTM_visitedByTapeHead` — the returning flavors visit
  exactly what the closed flavors visit, at every time.

/-- **R1 lockstep, suppressing flavor** (spec, fill pending — design §12;
[Bon26], `rename_executes`). The transported run *is* the transport of the
source run, at every time and with the step count preserved exactly: `t`
host steps simulate `t` source steps. No liveness guard is needed — the
transformer preserves states, so a halted source transports to a halted
host and both runs stall together.

**Proof sketch.** One-step commutation plus
`Turing.MultiTapeTM.runFrom_comm_of_step`. For the step: a halted source
makes both sides the identity. For a live source state, the host reads the
source symbols through `ι` (the transport puts source tape `i` at `ι i`),
so the host applies `embedActionCore` of the very action the source
applies; componentwise, selected tapes update as the source's
(`Turing.Action.apply` through the `embedSlot` inverse, whose two
equations `embedSlot ι (ι i) = some i` and `embedSlot ι j = none` off the
range are the `List.find?` glue obligations), unselected tapes receive the
stationary no-write action, the capture tape appends the optional emission
at head `|pre ++ c.output|` (`Turing.FinTM.bufferTape_append`, exactly as
in `capture_apply`), silence keeps the output at `out₀`, and the states
agree. -/

source run, at every time and with the step count preserved exactly;
emissions are forwarded, so the host's output is `pre` followed by the
source's output at every instant (through the transport).

replaced by the output clause: the one-step commutation appends the
optional emission after `pre` (associativity of `++`, exactly as in

/-- **R1′ through-halt contract, suppressing flavor** (spec, fill pending —
round-1 repair R1): if the source first halts at time `T`, the returning
embedding runs in `Sum.inl`-lockstep through every live time and, at `T`,
sits at the **live return anchor** over the completed transport — the
halting transition's emission recorded on `cap`, the source tape residue
preserved on the selected bank, the frame untouched — having visited the
anchor first exactly there. The start must be **live** (`hc` — round-2
blocker: an initially halted `c` at `T = 0` satisfies the other hypotheses
vacuously while the handover state projection would demand
`none = some (Sum.inr ())`; under `hlive` **and** `hhalt` together, `hc` is
equivalent to `0 < T` — the forward direction uses `hhalt`, the reverse
`hlive 0` (round-3 finding 1 sharpened the earlier `hhalt`-only phrasing).
The smallest case is the round-1 counterexample cured: a one-state source
that emits and halts on its first transition lands at time `1` in
`Sum.inr ()` with `pre ++ [b]` on the capture tape (the audit's S8 check).

**Proof sketch.** Live times: the `Sum.inl` branch applies the very core of
`Turing.embedSilentTM`, so `embedSilentTM_runFrom`'s one-step commutation
transports verbatim under `Cfg.mapState Sum.inl` (`Cfg.mapState_apply`).
At the halting step, the source action's tape and capture effects are those
of the closed flavor — `Turing.FinTM.bufferTape_append` records the final
emission — while the successor `Option.elim` lands in `Sum.inr ()` instead
of `none`; the anchor cannot occur earlier because live source states map
into `Sum.inl`. Fill obligations, named: the two `Option.elim` successor
equations; the through-halt step case; the first-visit projection. -/

The retrofit inventories (`audits/retrofit-inventory/`) found, three times
independently, that no old-code R1 consumer can be proved from this file's
public surface: the frame lemmas cover only unselected tapes, and
`embedSlot_selected` is private. These four projections export the
selected-tape fields of the two configuration transports. They are
skeleton-time proofs (statement-phase additions flagged for the A-S1
audit): each is definitional at `embedSlot_selected`. -/

# §12 F2 / continuation A2 — complete, 2 of 2

Both remaining targets are proved. `Catalog.lean` checks with **zero error diagnostics and zero sorry warnings**, completing the §12 routine layer's 56 statements. The final facade check also passes. There is no remaining frontier and no admitted new helper.

## Repository, order, and frozen scope

- Repository: `https://github.com/Shilun-Allan-Li/tcslib`.
- Required starting branch: `complexity/arora-barak-ch3-4` (not `main`).
- Recorded base: `3099ad2a4da95f0560bb6bd5ed54d3fcecd73ed9`.
- Working/delivery branch: `fill/s12-f2-A2`.
- First commit, loop ledger: `35a96f2c9598541d9260b87911f7e98c513f0bdb`.
- Second commit, forwarding controller / delivery HEAD: `ed8819661a78c1c9a50da95bfd65ffa93b4cde12`.
- Only changed tracked path: `TCSlib/Complexity/TuringMachine/Build/Catalog.lean`.
- The loop target was completed and checked before work on the forwarding controller. Patch order records this order.
- No push, PR, rebase, or `lake build` was performed.

All 378 existing declarations retain their order, signatures, docstrings, imports, options, and non-target bodies, including all F1 material and the 306 F2A private helpers. Only the two original `sorry` bodies and 45 new private source declarations differ. Removing those new helper blocks and restoring the two original bodies reconstructs the base file **byte for byte**; see `verification/owned-file-audit.json` and the included audit script. No public declaration was added, removed, or restated. No existing docstring appendix was added or changed; historical “fill pending” wording remains frozen.

The report at `audits/routine-f1-agent-reports/batchF2A-REPORT.md`, both briefs, the infrastructure/F1 resolutions, and their binding audit obligations supplied the proof routes below.

## 1. `Turing.FinTM.exists_loopTM_spaceUsed` — PROVED

The round-1 Part-2 assessment row states:

> **Supported, same host family.** The old orbit test through indices `0,…,R(n)` retains its time clause and obtains all-time work space `c(S(n)+T(n)+1)`. Actual startup/round windows are within `T(n)`, restart body heads at the origin, and either return silently or halt with the singleton verdict; their accumulated visited sets fit fixed origin-centred intervals. The fuel word has length at most `T(n)`, and the attached host reuses its counter/capture tapes. A more explicit space derivation appears in answer 5 below.

Witness: the existing private host `f2_loopHost body F anchor false`. The received `f2_loopHost_contracts` and the private segment summation `a2_loop_halted_run` establish the unchanged orbit-test function and time clause. If `c₀` is the received time coefficient and `k` is this host's tape count, the theorem chooses **`c = c₀ + 19*k`**.

For `n = x.length` and `ℓ = (Nat.bits (R n)).length`, every host head is bounded at every time by the fixed radius

`B = S n + 4*ℓ + 8`.

Taking inclusive visited-set cardinalities gives

`space ≤ k*(2*B+1) = k*(2*S n + 8*ℓ + 17) ≤ 19*k*(S n + T n + 1) ≤ c*(S n + T n + 1)`.

The number of rounds never multiplies this radius or its cardinality. It appears only in the required time bound `c*(T n+1)*(R n+2)`.

### Six-step binding ledger

| Answer-5 step | Discharged by | Proof obligation and bound |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Actual source windows | `a2_loop_start_prefix`, `a2_loop_round`, `a2_call_prefix`; target's `hlocal` | Startup prefixes are within the supplied startup endpoint; returning rounds use their supplied endpoint; accepting rounds use the first actual halt. Each endpoint is at most `T n`, so precisely the supplied budgeted source-space hypotheses apply. |
| 2. Origin-based interval union | `a2_source_radius`, `a2_call_run`, `a2_call_heads`, `a2_segments` | The unit-step walk contains the interval between zero and its endpoint in its visited set. A total-space bound `S n` therefore bounds each source head by `[-S n,S n]`. Captured calls project those source heads. The same fixed common interval is reused across all calls and all halted tails, rather than summing round footprints. |
| 3. Fuel source and retained bank | `a2_fuel_heads`, `a2_loop_prepare`, `a2_call_heads` | Fuel prefixes use `hFspace`. Preparation returns the actual fuel endpoint together with its `S n` head bound; subsequent call configurations retain that same fuel configuration. |
| 4. Fixed-width counters | received `f2_loop_fuel_width`, `f2_loopDebit_iterate_length`, `f2_loopHost_fuel_setup`, `f2_loopHost_reject`; `a2_loop_prepare`, `a2_loop_round` | `ℓ ≤ T n`. Fuel installation costs `3*ℓ+4` bounded work steps; its potentially long native-input rewind leaves work heads unchanged via `f2_rewind_heads`. Debits preserve the word length, including final underflow. A round's stop/debit administration is bounded by `2*ℓ+5`, with fixed acceptance allowances. |
| 5. No accumulating output log | `a2_call_prefix`, `a2_loop_start_prefix`, `a2_loop_round` | Append-only output makes every prefix of a silent startup/rejection silent. An accepting endpoint has exactly `[true]`, so capture length is at most one. The retained phase contracts rewind/reuse the capture bank between calls. |
| 6. Flag, boundaries, cardinalities | `a2_call_heads`, `a2_heads_steps`, `a2_heads_join`, `a2_segments`; received `f2_space_radius`; target's `hall` | The flag head is zero in each captured-call projection. Fixed controller movements are covered by the common radius `S n+4*ℓ+8`. Its interval cardinality is summed over the fixed tape count, then `ℓ ≤ T n` is applied. |

The assembled proof deliberately uses a conservative common interval: width-bounded administrative segments enlarge a phase's radius by their duration. This is a fixed allowance around each canonical call, not an allowance accumulated from round to round. The source/fuel projection lemmas supply the sharper source bounds within calls, and the existing phase endpoints reset the administrative starting positions.

The helper `a2_loop_halted_run` is a private copy of the received decision-segment summation in `Build/Loop.lean`. It does not introduce a new loop machine. The scope remains the decision export; no space theorem for the configuration/result-bearing siblings is claimed.

## 2. `Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_pairMapSnd_spaceUsed` — PROVED

The matching round-1 assessment states:

> **Supported as an existential target, but not by the documented old witness (R4).** It retains the original linear-plus-`Tg` time and adds `Sg(n)+c(n+1)` space, assuming monotonicity of both budgets and all-time payload space. A controller can first validate and buffer the pair, output the encoded first component, and simulate `Mg` on a buffered second component while forwarding its output. Source work-head trajectories remain unchanged, giving coefficient 1 on `Sg`, and the input buffer/administration costs only `O(n+1)`; this construction must replace the capture-all-output sketch.

The round-2 R4 ledger further requires:

> The payload work bank starts blank with heads at zero; administrative stages leave those heads stationary. During simulation its head positions are exactly source positions, possibly repeated during controller microsteps. After payload halt, the host freezes those heads. Hence the payload bank's contribution is at most `Sg |b|`, with coefficient **one**, at every horizon.

Witness: **`a2_mapTM Mg true`**, the commissioned new forwarding controller. It has two input-buffer tapes plus exactly `Mg.k` source tapes. It does not use the captured-output `pairMapTM` witness. The auxiliary `a2_mapTM Mg false` freezes at its live payload entry and serves only to certify the first arrival at that seam; the theorem's witness always uses forwarding mode.

### Named construction obligations

| Stage or obligation | Declarations | Established behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Finite control and physical action table | `a2_MapState`, `a2_mapStateFintype`, `a2_mapAct`, `a2_mapTM` | Parse a doubled prefix and delimiter; buffer both input components; rewind buffers; emit the encoded prefix; simulate the payload. Administrative actions leave every payload tape blank with its head at zero. |
| Validating buffer stage | `a2_map_first`, `a2_map_block`, `a2_map_suffix`, `a2_map_parse` | Recognize the exact `pairDecode` grammar, buffer the decoded first component and complete suffix, and reject malformed encodings with empty output. |
| Buffer rewinds, including empty buffers | `a2_map_backB`, `a2_map_backA`, `a2_map_finish` | Left overshoot and right entry establish the virtual input at position zero of its buffer and the first-component emission at its beginning. The empty-list cases are in the proofs. |
| Encoded-prefix emission | `a2_map_emit` | Emit doubled bits of `a` followed by `01`, in `2*|a|+2` steps; the prefix is exactly `pairEncode a []`. |
| Complete setup bound | `a2_map_setup` | From the genuine initial configuration, reach a valid payload seam or a silent malformed-input halt in at most `5*(n+1)` steps. |
| Seam and unchanged source origins | `a2_mapEntered`, `a2_mapSetup_stationary`, `a2_mapSetup_step`, `a2_mapSetup_run`, `a2_mapSetup_head_step`, `a2_mapSetup_heads`, `a2_map_launch` | Choose the first live payload entry, identify its entire configuration, transfer every pre-entry prefix to the real witness, and keep source heads zero throughout setup. |
| Both virtual-input boundary clamps | `a2_mapVirtual`, `a2_mapVirtual_step`, `a2_mapVirtual_run` | The second buffer is read at source input position minus one. `virtualMove_correct` proves the left and right clamps and tag update for every virtual input, including empty `b`. No nonempty-input premise appears. Each payload source step takes exactly one host step. |
| Forwarded output and final emission | `a2_mapVirtual_step`, `a2_mapVirtual_run` | The source action's output is the physical host action's output. Host output equals `pairEncode a [] ++ source.output`; no work tape stores forwarded output. The last halting action and all stationary post-halt times are included. |
| Malformed rejection and its tail | `a2_map_reject`; target's `none` branches | The real witness agrees with setup at every time, halts silently by the setup bound, and freezes thereafter. Payload heads remain at their source origins. |
| Coefficient-one source containment | `a2_map_space`; target's local `hp` in each decode branch | For each payload tape and host horizon `t`, the host visited set is a subset of the source visited set through horizon `t`: setup positions map to source time zero; later positions map to source time `v-u ≤ t`. Sum the source cardinalities once, with no tape-count multiplier on `Sg`. |
| Administrative and halted-tail bounds | target's `hshort`, `ha`, `hb`, `hrun` | Before the seam, unit-step movement over at most `5*(n+1)` steps bounds both buffers. Afterwards the first-buffer head is fixed at `|a|`, and the second-buffer head lies in `[-1,|b|]`, including after source halt. |

The configuration/read/action helpers `a2_mapCfg`, `a2_mapCfg_read`, and `a2_map_move` support the exact setup traces. `a2_mapSumEquiv` and `a2_map_sum` are private copies of the existing finite-sum splitting facts, needed before their later in-file counterparts are available.

### R4 constants and unchanged time clause

Let `n = x.length`, and on a valid input let `pairDecode x = some (a,b)`. Put `D = 5*(n+1)` and let `u` be the first payload-entry time.

- `u ≤ 5*(n+1)` and every payload source step takes one host step, so completion occurs by `u + Tg |b| ≤ 5*(n+1+Tg |b|) ≤ 5*(n+1+Tg n)`.
- Both buffer visited sets lie in `[-D,D]`. Their combined contribution is at most `2*(2*D+1) = 20*(n+1)+2 ≤ 22*(n+1)`.
- Payload tape containment gives `space ≤ Sg |b| + 22*(n+1) ≤ Sg n + 22*(n+1)`. The second inequality uses `hSg` and `|b| ≤ n`.
- On malformed input, the source bank is idle at zero; its origin contribution is bounded by `hgs x t`. The same `22*(n+1)` administrative allowance covers validation and the halted tail.

Thus R4 permits `A=22`, `B=5`, and the theorem uses the **single constant `c=22`** for both conjuncts. The original function, failure result `[]`, hypotheses, and time expression `c*(n+1+Tg n)` are unchanged.

## Verification

- Pinned Lean: `leanprover/lean4:v4.25.0`.
- Pinned mathlib: `029db123ddaa7f8fd0d18cea3b1b33bf84dacd1e`; manifest unchanged.
- Ran `lake exe cache get`; all 7506 requested cache files were obtained and decompressed.
- Completed the prescribed 65-module bootstrap, inserting `Build/Embed`, `Build/Seam`, `Build/Catalog`, `NDCodes`, `Formulas/QBF`, and `Formulas/QBFEncoding` before the facade. The supplemental bootstrap log records all 71 checks as PASS. Its earlier Catalog snapshot still had the original admissions; final evidence is in `final-sweep.log`.
- Final Catalog check: exit 0, fresh `.olean`, zero errors, zero sorry warnings.
- Final `TCSlib/Complexity/TuringMachine` facade check: exit 0, fresh `.olean`, zero errors, zero sorry warnings.
- Both required axiom prints, and all 17 inherited F2 target prints, are exactly `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`. None contains `sorryAx`. See `axioms.log` and `verification/axioms.lean`.
- Frozen-text reconstruction, declaration inventory/order, imports/options/docstrings, and exclusive-file audit: PASS.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- Scoped campaign style checker: **0 FAIL, 1 WARN**. The warning is the 10,876-line file; the brief explicitly forbids splitting it and freezes all received material. The new controller and local proof interfaces account for the growth. No public helper surface was added.
- Both patches replay against the recorded base in a temporary index and reconstruct the exact delivery tree `2c662672134a93b4a6f60f812532b035cc1fe416`.
- Git bundle verification: PASS; it requires the recorded base commit.

Final sweep log tail:

```text
PASS TCSlib/Complexity/TuringMachine/Build/Catalog: exit=0; errors=0; sorry_warnings=0; fresh_olean=yes

$ bash scripts/lean_check_tree.sh TCSlib/Complexity/TuringMachine
PASS TCSlib/Complexity/TuringMachine: exit=0; errors=0; sorry_warnings=0; fresh_olean=yes

FINAL SUMMARY: Catalog and facade PASS; errors=0; sorry_warnings=0.
Both target axiom footprints: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]; no sorryAx.
```

Required axiom-print results:

```text
'Turing.FinTM.exists_loopTM_spaceUsed' depends on axioms: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
'Turing.FinTM.computesFunInTime_pairMapSnd_spaceUsed' depends on axioms: [propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]
```

### Environment note

The pinned toolchain and dependency cache were reused from the prior agent's local environment; this checkout's `.lake/packages` points to that pinned dependency tree. `lake exe cache get` was run here, and TCSlib modules were checked into this checkout's own `.lake/tcslib-check-oleans` tree.

This execution environment cannot resolve the stock binaries' `/proc/<current numeric pid>/exe` lookup. The same external `LD_PRELOAD` shim as the prior delivery maps only that exact self-process path to `/proc/self/exe`. Its source is included as `environment/self_exe.c`. It does not change Lean proof terms, the kernel, toolchain sources, or repository files. No `native_decide`, axiom declaration, unsafe proof mechanism, FFI proof hook, or admission was introduced. On a normal environment this shim is unnecessary; if needed, compile it outside the repository with `cc -shared -fPIC -o self_exe.so self_exe.c -ldl` and set `LD_PRELOAD` to that absolute shared-library path before running the pinned stock binaries.

Other chapter-3/4 statement surfaces retain their out-of-scope admissions. The zero-sorry claim here concerns the completed §12 layer and this owned file, not the whole repository.

## Requested shared lemmas

None required for this delivery. All new helpers remain private in the owned file. No shared-file edit was made.

## Escalations

None. Neither frozen statement was weakened or repaired.

## New private source declarations

Every new source declaration is listed below in file order. Compiler-generated constructors, recursors, the derived `DecidableEq` instance, and equation/instance internals belong to their private source declarations. All 45 declarations are complete; none contains an admission.

## Archive and integration

The archive contains this report, the full owned source, two ordered format patches, `fill-s12-f2-A2.bundle`, `final-sweep.log`, `axioms.log`, `SHA256SUMS`, reproducible audit/axiom inputs, and supplemental environment/bootstrap evidence. Report and verification files are delivery artifacts outside the repository; the commit series touches only the owned Lean file.

From the archive directory, run `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`. To integrate, start from the recorded base and apply the two files listed in `patches/series` with `git am -3` in order. Alternatively, fetch branch `fill/s12-f2-A2` from the bundle into a repository that already contains the recorded base. The included patch-replay log confirms the reconstructed tree equals the delivery tree.

After the pinned dependencies and bootstrap modules are available, rerun the two `lean_check_tree.sh` commands shown above, then run `verification/axioms.lean` with the scratch olean tree first in `LEAN_PATH`. `verification/audit_owned_file.py <repository-root>` rechecks the frozen material against the recorded base; `verification/check_style.py <repository-root>` invokes the repository's campaign checker on the owned file.

## Local notation

`n` is the complete input length; `a,b` are decoded pair components. In the loop proof, `ℓ` is fuel-bit length, `B` is the common head radius, `k` is host tape count, and `c₀` is the received time coefficient. In the map proof, `D=5*(n+1)` bounds administrative head positions and `u` is the first payload-entry time. R4's `A,B` denote space/time coefficients only in its constants paragraph; they are `22,5`. Integer intervals include both endpoints. All Lean identifiers retain their source meanings.

# Retrofit inventory — `Build/Loop.lean` (commissioned report, verbatim)

inventory agent at HEAD `af3952a3` (file unchanged since earlier that day);

# Retrofit inventory: privates in `TCSlib/Complexity/TuringMachine/Build/Loop.lean`

**Bottom line.** Only two families can be acted on under the strict-simplification bar:
- **8 dead declarations** (about 160 lines).
- **One 3-declaration family (H4).** It re-derives a forwarding lemma the file avoided because it was unproved at the time. That lemma, `Turing.emit_run` in Wrappers, is now proved.

The other 87 declarations whose role matches R1, R2 or the catalog have to be left alone. They all fail on structure:
- the hosts are single, hand-built transition tables (not composites);
- the decision/find loop runs the body again every round, which R2 cannot express;
- the phase boundaries are not `Cfg.ofWords`-shaped.

## How the inventory was built

- Every declaration was taken from the source with a Python regex over `^(private )?(noncomputable )?(def|theorem|lemma|abbrev|structure|inductive|instance) <name>`. Two docstring lines that start with the word "lemma" (5497, 5506) were excluded.
- **Result: 222 declarations = 214 private + 8 public.** `grep -c '^private '` gives 215; the extra hit is the docstring line 2703, not a declaration.
- A partition of the 214 into 33 families was checked by script: every private appears exactly once.
- References were computed by token matching on bodies with comments stripped, then taken transitively from the 8 publics.
- Catalog copies were matched by name (`f2_<name>`, `a2_<name>`) and compared text-for-text after removing the prefix.

## 1. Public declarations and file layout

| # | Line | Public declaration | Role | Privates reached (transitively) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 122 | `Turing.stateWord` | Seam word assignment: state on tape 0, other tapes blank | 0 |
| 2 | 140 | `Turing.loop_run` | Frozen summation lemma (empty-output terminal); nothing in the file uses it | 0 |
| 3 | 2392 | `Turing.FinTM.exists_loopCfgTM` | Configuration-level loop: startup, per-round accept-or-advance segments, halted `[false]` terminal | 85 |
| 4 | 2519 | `exists_loopTM` | Decision loop, budget `c(T+1)(R+2)` (proved via #3 and `loop_halted_run`) | 86 |
| 5 | 2633 | `exists_loopFindTM` | Find loop: first accepting payload, or `[]` | 86 |
| 6 | 5508 | `exists_emitLoopTM` | Emitting loop: concatenation of per-round chunks | 82 |
| 7 | 5645 | `exists_installCallTM` | Clean call, install mode: `Cfg.ofWords` seam to `Cfg.ofWords` seam, first return, `0 < C.k` | 91 |
| 8 | 5691 | `exists_emitCallTM` | Clean call, emit mode: argument kept, `f arg` sent to output | 91 |

The privates form three independent clusters:
- **Core decision/find loop**: 95 privates. #3–#5 use all except the 8 dead ones; #6 shares 54 of them.
- **`emCall*`**: 91 privates, used only by #7 and #8. They use no core privates.
- **`emLoop*`**: 28 privates, used only by #6.

**File layout**
- 1–14: header, imports (Convention, Wrappers, Composition, Mathlib).
- 16–116: module docstring.
- 118–177: `namespace Turing` (`stateWord`, `loop_run`).
- 179–5713: `namespace Turing.FinTM`.
  - 181–322: run/trace utilities.
  - 324–437: debit arithmetic and buffer helpers.
  - 439–563: standalone debit machine (dead).
  - 565–717: stop-at-anchor body wrapper.
  - 719–836: host state and controller (`loopHost`).
  - 838–2187: host phase lemmas.
  - 2188–2359: `loopHost_bound` and `loopHost_contracts`.
  - 2361–2697: publics #3–#5 and the two summation lemmas.
  - 2699–4605: `/-! ### Clean-call phase machinery` (`emCall*`; stray sub-comment at 3356).
  - 4607–5595: `/-! ### Forwarding loop controller` (`emLoop*`) and #6.
  - 5597–5711: publics #7 and #8.

## 2. Private families

Line counts include docstrings. All families have 16 or fewer members, so every member is listed.

### Core loop — 95 privates, lines 181–2614

**F1. Run/trace utilities** — 9 members, 181–322, about 134 lines.
- Members: `loop_live_prefix` 182, `loop_silent_prefix` 193, `loop_first_halt` 207, `loop_orbit_inv` 230, `loop_fuel_width` 240, `loop_input_move_le` 247, `loop_input_run_le` 261, `loop_output_length_le` 277, `loop_rewind_bounded` 294.
- Role: generic run facts — live prefix, first-halt cut, orbit invariant, fuel width, input/output displacement bounds, bounded input rewind.
- **KEEP** (8). `loop_silent_prefix` is **DEAD**.
- Not replaceable: §12 has no lemmas of this kind. `loop_rewind_bounded` already wraps the public `rewind_scan`; `loop_fuel_width` cites the public `output_length_le`.

**F2. Fixed-width debit arithmetic** — 10 members, 324–411, about 79 lines.
- Members: `loopDebit` 326, `loopBorrowPos` 332, `loopBorrowPos_le` 337, `loopDebit_length` 343, `loopValue` 349, `loopValue_bits` 354, `loopDebit_value` 365, `loopDebit_success` 379, `loopDebit_iterate_length` 390, `loopDebit_iterate_value` 400.
- **KEEP.** The catalog has `incFixed`/`incrementTM` (increment) but no decrement.

**F3. Buffer read/write helpers** — 2 members, 413–437.
- Members: `loopBuffer_read` 414, `loopBuffer_write` 422.
- **KEEP.**

**F4. Standalone one-tape debit machine** — 6 members, 439–563, about 125 lines.
- Members: `loopDebitTM` 443, `loopDebitCfg` 459, `loopBorrow_step` 466, `loopBorrow_run` 492, `loopBorrow_rewind` 517, `loopBorrow_correct` 551.
- Its own docstring says it "privately re-derives the counter template".
- **DEAD.** The members refer only to each other. `loopBorrow_correct` has no referrers; its only other mention is the historical docstring at 2205. The host performs the borrow itself in F13.

**F5. Stop-at-anchor body wrapper** — 6 members, 565–717, about 148 lines.
- Members: `loopBodyTM` 569, `loopBodyCfg` 592, `loopBody_stop` 604, `loopBody_step` 622, `loopBody_run` 669, `loopBody_capture` 697.
- Role: a release bit forces one action at the anchor; the next anchor entry halts the body; a one-cell flag tape records "returned to anchor" versus "genuine halt".
- **Role matches R2 (`seamReleaseTM` plus exit dispatch) → LEAVE** (5 members).
- `loopBody_capture` is **DEAD**: no referrers, superseded by `loopHost_body_capture` through `loopBodySource`.

**F6. Host state and controller definitions** — 3 members, 719–836.
- Members: `LoopHostState` 720, `loopControlAction` 739, `loopHost` 763 (14-phase controller).
- **KEEP.**

**F7. Relocation and capture glue (R1-shaped)** — 12 members, about 116 lines.
- Members: `loopFuelSource` 724, `loopBodySource` 732, `loopHost_body_capture` 840, `loopHost_fuel_capture` 854, `loopHost_init` 866, `loopFuelCfg` 1076, `loopFuel_run` 1085, `loopFuel_init` 1098, `loopFuelCaptured` 1368, `loopBodyPadded` 1486, `loopCall` 1496, `loopBodySource_run` 1506.
- Role: move the fuel machine onto the right tape block and the stopped body onto the left block (public `rightAction`/`leftAction`, `rightCfg_run`/`leftCfg_run` from Simulation.lean), with output captured via the public `captureAction`/`capture_run`.
- **Role matches R1 → LEAVE.**

**F7b. Relocated layout versus controller frame identities** — 4 members, about 152 lines.
- Members: `loopFuelCaptured_frame` 1387, `loopReady_call` 1562, `loopCall_frame` 1679, `loopCall_reframe` 1706.
- Role: tape-block bookkeeping that matches relocated configurations against `loopFrame`.
- **Role matches R1 (`embedSilentCfg` frame parameters) → LEAVE.**

**F8. Controller frame algebra** — 9 members, about 115 lines.
- Members: `loopControl_idle` 875, `loopFrame` 900, `loopWrite` 920, `loopControl_apply` 927, `loopFrame_payload` 1115, `loopFrame_counter` 1125, `loopFrame_flag` 1881, `loopFlag_clear` 1890, `loopControl_payload` 1019.
- **KEEP.**

**F9. Payload replay (find mode)** — 7 members, about 173 lines.
- Members: `loopReplayTM` 963, `loopReplayCfg` 973, `loopReplay_step` 979, `loopReplay_run` 1003, `loopHost_replay` 1039, `loopHost_payload_rewind` 1973, `loopHost_frame_replay` 2026.
- **KEEP.** No catalog row emits a tape's contents to the output. `loopHost_replay` already relocates with a single `rightCfg_run` citation.

**F10. Fuel setup, phases 0–3 (capture tape to counter)** — 9 members, 1133–1365, about 225 lines.
- Members: `loopHost_fuel_rewind` 1137, `loopCopyTape` 1187, `loopCopy_read` 1191, `loopCopy_erase` 1196, `loopCopy_initial` 1209, `loopCopy_final` 1217, `loopHost_fuel_copy` 1231, `loopHost_fuel_return` 1282, `loopHost_fuel_setup` 1337.
- **Role matches the catalog's `transferTM` → LEAVE.**

**F11. Startup, prepare, release** — 5 members, about 116 lines.
- Members: `loopHost_input_rewind` 883, `loopHost_prepare` 1446, `loopReady` 1375, `loopHost_release` 1601, `loopHost_start` 1632.
- **KEEP.** Borderline: this is a linear chain of phases (R2-shaped), but its boundaries are not canonical, so it would be LEAVE anyway.

**F12. Body-call returns** — 2 members, 1515–1675.
- Members: `loopHost_anchor_return` 1521, `loopHost_halt_return` 1652.
- **Role matches R2 (first-return cut) → LEAVE.**

**F13. In-host borrow and reject** — 5 members, 1736–1967, about 213 lines.
- Members: `loopHost_borrow_step` 1738, `loopHost_borrow_run` 1776, `loopHost_borrow_rewind` 1809, `loopHost_borrow` 1859, `loopHost_reject` 1901.
- **KEEP** (debit logic).

**F14. Accept, round, bound, contracts** — 4 members, 2056–2359, about 302 lines.
- Members: `loopHost_accept` 2061, `loopHost_round` 2127, `loopHost_bound` 2190, `loopHost_contracts` 2214.
- **KEEP.** These are the implementation behind #3–#5.

**F15. Summation** — 2 members.
- Members: `loop_halted_run` 2445 (used by #4), `loop_find_run` 2584 (used by #5).
- **KEEP.** R2 provides no summation over loop rounds.

### Clean call (`emCall*`) — 91 privates, lines 2707–4605

**G1. Captured evaluation on a virtual input** — 6 members, 2707–2835.
- Members: `emCallIdleTM` 2709, `emCallEvalTM` 2717, `emCallEvalCfg` 2730, `emCall_eval_run` 2741, `emCall_eval_initial` 2767, `emCall_eval_first` 2800.
- **KEEP.** The virtual input comes from `bufferedCompTM`'s second phase. Embed.lean's own header puts this out of R1's scope (R1 does not "alter the source input word").

**G2. Marked-interval cleaner** — 12 members, 2837–3067, about 220 lines.
- Members: `emCallInterval` 2839, `emCallCleared` 2844, `emCall_cleared_step` 2848, `emCallClearTM` 2862, `emCallClearCfg` 2881, `emCall_clear_left` 2890, `emCall_cleared_zero` 2939, `emCall_cleared_all` 2946, `emCall_clear_scan` 2958, `emCall_origin_erase` 2985, `emCall_clear_origin` 3000, `emCall_clear_run` 3033.
- **Role matches the catalog's `clearTM` → LEAVE.**

**G3. Visited-interval tracker** — 16 members, 3069–3358, about 275 lines.
- Members: `emCallSpan` 3071, `emCall_span_extend` 3076, `emCallSlots` 3089, `emCallTrackTM` 3096, `emCallTrackCfg` 3118, `emCallTrackMid` 3127, `emCall_track_action` 3137, `emCall_track_stamp` 3174, `emCallLo` 3200, `emCallHi` 3206, `emCall_track_extent` 3213, `emCall_track_support` 3235, `emCall_span_zero` 3263, `emCall_track_initial` 3275, `emCall_track_run` 3302, `emCall_track_computes` 3348.
- **KEEP.** R1's space lemmas are proof-level statements, not marker tapes written by a machine.

**G4. Tracker-to-cleaner bridge and first-entry cut** — 4 members, 3360–3466.
- Members: `emCall_span_interval` 3362, `emCall_track_clearable` 3377, `emCall_first_entry` 3415, `emCall_clear_first` 3439.
- **KEEP.** `seamCompTM` takes a cut as a hypothesis; nothing in §12 produces one.

**G5. Right-boundary normalizer** — 9 members, 3468–3639, about 164 lines.
- Members: `emCallRightTM` 3471, `emCallRightCfg` 3487, `emCall_right_step` 3494, `emCall_right_run` 3507, `emCallRightScan` 3520, `emCall_right_scan` 3529, `emCall_right_finish` 3571, `emCall_right_endpoint` 3601, `emCall_right_computes` 3627.
- **KEEP, borderline.** The `.inl` branch is `embedEmitRetTM` with the identity selection (halt-to-live), followed by an input-head scan. Rebuilding it as R1′ plus `seamCompTM` adds a dispatch step and is a rewrite, not a simplification.

**G6. Prepared-evaluation composite** — 1 member: `emCall_prepared_eval_first` 3651.
- **KEEP.**

**G7. Generic relocation core** — 4 members, 3683–3758, about 73 lines.
- Members: `emCallAction` 3685, `emCallCfg` 3694, `emCall_apply` 3705, `emCall_relocate_run` 3722.
- This is the R1 core in disguise: a partial inverse `select` plays the role of `embedSlot`; `emCall_apply` corresponds to `embedSilent_apply`; `emCall_relocate_run` corresponds to `embedEmitTM_runFrom`, plus a state embedding and a guard.
- **Role matches R1 → LEAVE.**

**G8. Two-tape finalizer** — 8 members, 3760–4040, about 274 lines.
- Members: `emCallFinishTM` 3763, `emCallFinishCfg` 3794, `emCall_erase_last` 3801, `emCall_finish_arg` 3815, `emCall_finish_rewind` 3864, `emCall_finish_transfer` 3903, `emCall_finish_erase` 3953, `emCall_finish_run` 3994.
- **Role matches the catalog's `clearTM`/`transferTM` → LEAVE.**

**G9a. Layout and selection algebra** — 13 members, 4052–4222, about 135 lines.
- Members: `emCallTripleIndex` 4053, `emCallTripleSelect` 4064, `emCall_triple_inverse` 4072, `emCallPairIndex` 4080, `emCallPairSelect` 4085, `emCall_pair_inverse` 4092, `emCallLayout` 4123, `emCall_layout_cases` 4130, `emCall_layout_triple` 4157, `emCall_layout_pair` 4185, `emCall_triple_pair` 4193, `emCall_triple_other` 4203, `emCall_pair_triple` 4217.
- These play the role of R1's `embedSlot_selected`/`embedSlot_unselected`, but those are **private** in Embed.lean, so they could not be cited even in principle.
- **Role matches R1 → LEAVE.**

**G9b. Frame transport identities** — 8 members, 4224–4497, about 183 lines.
- Members: `emCallFrame` 4226, `emCallBankFrame` 4234, `emCall_bank_initial` 4249, `emCall_bank_final` 4287, `emCall_prepare_initial` 4382, `emCall_prepare_final` 4395, `emCall_finish_initial` 4451, `emCall_finish_final` 4478.
- **Role matches R1 → LEAVE.**

**G9c. Controller and phase sequencing** — 10 members, 4042–4605, about 216 lines.
- Members: `emCallSource` 4044, `emCallState` 4049, `emCallTM` 4101, `emCall_bank_step` 4331, `emCall_banks_run` 4362, `emCall_prepare_run` 4422, `emCall_finalize_run` 4501, `emCall_complete` 4532, `emCall_exit_fixed` 4560, `emCall_first` 4581.
- Each phase ends with a silent dispatch (`controlAction 0`), which is `seamCompTM`'s dispatch step.
- **Role matches R2 → LEAVE.** `emCall_exit_fixed`/`emCall_first` supply the public first-return clause and stay regardless.

### Forwarding loop (`emLoop*`) — 28 privates, lines 4609–5466

**H1. Output-prefix commutation** — 2 members: `emLoop_step_prefix` 4611, `emLoop_run_prefix` 4630.
- **KEEP.**

**H2. Forwarding host definition** — 1 member: `emLoopHost` 4643.
- Its body branch uses `emitAction`; every other state falls through to `loopHost.tr`.
- **KEEP.**

**H3. Verbatim re-proofs of `loopHost` phase lemmas** — 14 members, 4657–5181, about 512 lines.
- Members: `emLoopHost_fuel_capture` 4658, `_init` 4670, `_input_rewind` 4680, `_fuel_rewind` 4699, `_fuel_copy` 4754, `_fuel_return` 4805, `_fuel_setup` 4860, `_prepare` 4896, `_release` 4939, `_borrow_step` 4967, `_borrow_run` 5005, `_borrow_rewind` 5038, `_borrow` 5088, `_reject` 5115.
- Scripted diff: 13 are byte-identical to their `loopHost_*` counterparts after renaming `emLoopHost`→`loopHost`. `_init` differs only by one extra simp lemma.
- **KEEP for this retrofit** — no §12 facility removes them. See the out-of-scope notes at the end.

**H4. Local re-derivation of `emit_run`** — 3 members, 5183–5240, about 56 lines.
- Members: `emLoopForwardCfg` 5185, `emLoop_forward_apply` 5192, `emLoop_forward_run` 5210.
- Its docstring (line 5206) says it was "proved locally so this batch does not depend on the concurrent `Turing.emit_run` admission". `Turing.emit_run` (Wrappers.lean:273) is now proved; Wrappers.lean has 0 sorries.
- **REPLACE (actionable).** Borderline on the facility: what replaces it is R1's exported precursor `emit_run` plus Simulation's `leftCfg_run`, not `embedEmitTM` itself. Details in section 3.

**H5. Forwarding call and round** — 7 members, 5242–5419, about 172 lines.
- Members: `emLoopCall` 5244, `emLoopCall_frame` 5255, `emLoopHost_body_forward` 5275, `emLoopHost_anchor_return` 5294, `emLoopCall_empty` 5332, `emLoopHost_start` 5346, `emLoopHost_round` 5370.
- **KEEP.** `emLoopHost_body_forward` becomes a direct `emit_run` citation if H4 is done. `emLoopHost_anchor_return` is a 36-line near-copy of `loopHost_anchor_return` (forward instead of capture).

**H6. Prefix summation** — 1 member: `emLoop_sum` 5427.
- **KEEP.**

### Dead-candidate evidence

`grep -nw` shows the declaration and nothing else for `loop_silent_prefix` (193) and `loopBody_capture` (697). The F4 names appear only inside lines 443–563, plus the docstring mention of `loopBorrow_correct` at 2205. The reachability computation puts all 8 outside the closure of every public declaration.

## 3. What would replace each REPLACE-role family, and why most must stay

Facts that block the replacements, checked against the sources:
- **R1 only describes its own machine.** It has lockstep lemmas for `embedSilentTM`/`embedEmitTM ι M` and the returning forms, but no "any host whose table agrees with the embedded action" lemma (the `hagree` form that `capture_run`/`emit_run` have).
- **The hosts are monolithic.** `loopHost` and `emCallTM` are single hand-built transition tables, not composites.
- **R2 has no way to start inside phase 2.** Every Seam theorem starts from `c₀.mapState Sum.inl`. `exists_loopCfgTM`'s per-round segments start at `cfg i`, inside the looping phase.
- **R2 has no back-edge.** `seamCompTM` is a one-shot sequential composite; the loop re-enters the body every round.
- **Catalog routines are canonical-only.** `transferTM_run`, `clearTM_run` and the rest are stated only from `Cfg.ofWords` with heads at the origin.

| Family | Would-be facility | Boundaries canonical? | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| F7 (12) | R1 `embedSilentTM`/`embedSilentRetTM` | No: fuel residue kept, capture head at word end | LEAVE. Already one- to three-line citations of public Simulation/Wrappers lemmas; citing R1 means redefining `loopHost` as a composite |
| F7b (4) | R1 `embedSilentCfg` frame parameters | No | LEAVE (only pays off after an R1/R2 rebuild of the host) |
| G7 (4), G9a (13), G9b (8) | R1 `embedEmitTM`, `embedSlot` | Internal boundaries are not: data with holes, arbitrary heads | LEAVE. Needs an agreement lemma R1 lacks, a state embedding, and a guard; `embedSlot` is private. **Strongest R1 candidate** if R1 ever exports an agreeing-host lockstep |
| F5 (5), F12 (2) | R2 `seamReleaseTM` plus exit dispatch | — | LEAVE. Release must be re-armed every round by the controller (phases 6 and 9 dispatch to `(anchor, true)`), plus the halt-kind flag tape |
| G9c (10) | R2 `seamCompTM_*_ofCfg` | Outer entry yes; internal boundaries and emit-mode exit (`with output := …`) no | LEAVE. The bank loop runs over `Fin (M.k+1)` inside one state space, while R2 composes exactly two machines |
| F10 (9) | Catalog `transferTM` (3\|w\|+3) | No: capture head starts at \|w\|, arbitrary residue; copies and erases in one forward pass | LEAVE |
| G2 (12) | Catalog `clearTM` (2\|w\|+2) | No: data with holes, cells at negative positions (`lo ≤ 0`), head anywhere, marker tapes | LEAVE |
| G8 (8) | Catalog `clearTM` + `transferTM` | No: both heads enter at the right blanks; emit mode replays to output, which no catalog row does | LEAVE |
| **H4 (3)** | `Turing.emit_run` (Wrappers E2, R1's precursor) + `leftCfg_run` | General configurations — no canonical boundary needed | **REPLACE.** Glue: a padded source `P.tr = leftAction 1 id (loopBodySource.tr …)`; `emitAction ∘ leftAction 1 id = leftAction 1 id ∘ emitAction` (closes by `simp` with `Option.map_id`); one `Cfg.ext` showing `emitCfg ∘ leftCfg = leftCfg ∘ emitCfg`; the liveness guard comes from `leftCfg_run`. About 15–25 lines replacing 56. Needs build confirmation |

## 4. Catalog copies (input for 12.2c — all KEEP here)

- **All 95 core privates (lines 181–2614) have Catalog copies. None of the 91 `emCall*` or 28 `emLoop*` privates do.**
- **94 are copied as `f2_<name>`.** They sit in Catalog.lean roughly between 5571 (`f2_loop_live_prefix`) and 7823 (`f2_loop_find_run`). Examples: `f2_LoopHostState` 6109, `f2_loopHost` 6152, `f2_loopHost_contracts` 7637.
  - 92 are byte-identical after removing the prefix.
  - 2 are strengthened with head-position bounds:
    - `f2_loopHost_prepare` 6835 (↔ `loopHost_prepare` 1446) adds `∀ i, -(T) ≤ c.workTapePos i ≤ T`, proved via `head_steps`.
    - `f2_loopHost_contracts` 7637 (↔ `loopHost_contracts` 2214) adds per-round and terminal head bounds, using `f2_loopCall_heads`.
    - So the Loop originals are weaker special cases of these.
- **1 is copied as `a2_loop_halted_run`** (Catalog 10667 ↔ `loop_halted_run` 2445, identical).
- **Catalog-only analogues with no Loop counterpart:**
  - `f2_loopCall_heads` 7588, `f2_exists_loopFind_space` 7935;
  - `a2_loop_prepare` 10426, `a2_loop_start_prefix` 10510 and `a2_loop_round` 10539 — space-ledger variants of `loopHost_prepare`, `loopHost_start` and `loopHost_round`, built over `f2_loopHost`.
- **The 8 dead declarations were copied too and are dead in Catalog as well.** `f2_loop_silent_prefix` and `f2_loopBody_capture` each occur once; `f2_loopBorrow_correct` occurs twice (the declaration at 5940 and a docstring at 7628). 12.2c can drop them on both sides.

## 5. Summary

| Classification | Count | Families | Estimated line impact in Loop.lean |
|---|---|---|---|
| DEAD-CANDIDATE | 8 | F4 (6), `loop_silent_prefix`, `loopBody_capture` | about −160 (192–200, 439–563, 692–717), plus fixing the docstring sentence at 2205 |
| REPLACE, actionable | 3 | H4 | about −30 to −40 net (56 lines out, 15–25 in); borderline because the facility is `emit_run` |
| REPLACE-R1 role → LEAVE | 41 | F7 12, F7b 4, G7 4, G9a 13, G9b 8 | 0 (about 660 lines; replacing them is a host rebuild) |
| REPLACE-R2 role → LEAVE | 17 | F5 5, F12 2, G9c 10 | 0 |
| REPLACE-CATALOG role → LEAVE | 29 | F10 9, G2 12, G8 8 | 0 |
| KEEP | 116 | F1 8, F2, F3, F6, F8, F9, F11, F13, F14, F15, G1, G3–G6, H1–H3, H5, H6 | 0 |
| **Total** | **214** | | **about −190 to −200 under the strict bar** |

Of the 116 KEEP, 95 are the core loop (all with Catalog copies, see section 4).

## Out of scope, but noticed

- **The largest duplication in the file is internal, not §12.** H3's 14 lemmas (about 512 lines, plus the 36-line near-copy `emLoopHost_anchor_return`) repeat `loopHost`'s phase lemmas, because `emLoopHost` agrees with `loopHost` on every non-body state. A machine-agreement transfer lemma would collapse them. That is a separate decision from this retrofit.
- **Stale status headers.** Embed.lean, Seam.lean and Catalog.lean still say "statement skeleton / all sorried", but `grep -c sorry` returns 0 for all three.
```
